/* ============================================================================
   blueAI on Desktop — icon set (single source of truth)

   Generated from the paths already used in index.html, then adopted BY it.

   SCOPE — read this precisely; a looser version of it has been wrong three times.

   As of batch 3 (2026-08-01), every ICON GLYPH in the product is named here and
   reached by name — §6 counts zero unnamed inline bodies and zero duplicated
   module paths. Deliberately NOT here, each for a stated reason:
     - the credits ring gauge (`.bai-credit-ring`) — a data-viz component whose
       arc is computed at runtime; it has no fixed glyph body to name
     - the "✦" sparkle — a text character, so it belongs to the type layer
   **§6 prints the live counts every run. Read them there; do not restate them
   here — a paragraph in this exact spot has been wrong in BOTH directions now
   (claiming SSOT while 23 paths were inline; claiming unnamed glyphs remained
   after they had all been named).**
     - style-guide.html renders every icon specimen from this object and THROWS on
       an unknown name, so the guide cannot show a glyph the product lacks.
     - index.html reaches every path through a name too. Three call shapes, all
       equivalent in output and each chosen for where it sits:
         * `iconSvg(BAI_ICONS.x, n)` — the common case.
         * `'…<svg …>' + BAI_ICONS.x + '</svg>…'` — spliced into JS-built HTML that
           needs its OWN svg attributes rather than iconSvg()'s.
         * `<svg … data-bai-icon="x"></svg>` in static markup, filled at boot.
           Static sites keep their authored attributes, and that matters: the
           hydrated nodes alone carry FIVE different stroke weights
           (1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 2, 2.2) while iconSvg() hardcodes 1.8 — routing them
           through it would silently restyle the header and sidebar.
           (index.html as a whole uses EIGHT: 1.3 1.4 1.6 1.7 1.8 2 2.2 2.4.
           An earlier version of this note said "four" in two places, with two
           DIFFERENT lists of four, neither complete. Counted, not recalled.)

   THREE HEADER CLAIMS HAVE BEEN WRONG — this is why the numbers now live in §6.
   v1: "neither file keeps its own copy", while 23 paths were still inline.
   v2: "most sit in static markup", while 27 of 44 were ordinary JS literals — an
       estimate that made the migration look harder than it was and left the
       duplication open for weeks.
   v3: "a true single source of truth for BOTH files", written immediately after
       the migration. Narrowly true of the paths in this object, false as a
       statement about the product, which still draws dozens of glyphs that never
       made it here. Each version was written by someone who had just done real
       work and rounded the result up.
   All three were caught by an independent audit, never by re-reading. The pattern
   is the point: a summary of your own work, written from satisfaction rather than
   measurement, is the least reliable sentence in any file.

   WHY THIS MATTERS BEYOND TIDINESS: a path with no name cannot be cross-checked.
   While 15 icons were anonymous literals, "is this the RIGHT icon for this
   component?" was unanswerable by any tool, and the guide showed a `gear` on the
   Ask-BlueAI tab for weeks with every check green. Naming them is what made
   ds-drift-check.js §9 possible.

   Convention: 24x24 viewBox, fill:none, stroke:currentColor, stroke-width 1.8,
   round caps/joins — applied by iconSvg(path, size) in index.html.

   THREE KNOWN INCONSISTENCIES, recorded rather than silently tidied (unifying them
   is a product change, not a documentation one):
     - `close` and `closeAlt` are two different paths for the same X glyph, both
       live in the product today.
     - Stroke weights are NOT unified: eight distinct values across index.html
       (1.3 1.4 1.6 1.7 1.8 2 2.2 2.4), five of them on the static icon nodes.
       iconSvg() uses 1.8; the header/sidebar gear+help are authored at 1.6, the
       sidebar nav items at 1.7, chevron/search at 2, the search-clear X at 2.2.
       Rendering any of these THROUGH iconSvg (as the style guide does) shows them
       at 1.8 — very slightly off from the product in those specific places.
     - The account "kebab" and the three titlebar window controls break the stroke
       convention (kebab is fill-based; the win* glyphs are 10x10 with per-element
       styling). They ARE here — batch 3 named them — with BAI_ICON_META entries so
       the guide renders them on their own terms instead of through the house wrapper.
   The sparkle is deliberately absent: the product uses the text glyph "✦", not
   an SVG, so it belongs to the type layer rather than the icon set.
