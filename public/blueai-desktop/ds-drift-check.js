   ds-drift-check.js — mechanical drift detector between the product and its
   design system. Run from this folder:  node ds-drift-check.js

   WHY THIS EXISTS
   The product and the style guide share their CSS and their icon set, so the
   VALUES in those two cannot drift. What the guide still authors by hand can:
     1. COPY      — a specimen can show invented strings. This happened twice
                    (a whole invented login-gate flow; a wrong OOC CTA) and both
                    times it took a human comparing screenshots to catch it.
     2. COVERAGE  — a new component can ship with no specimen at all.
     3. ICONS     — the guide can name a glyph the product does not have, or name
                    a real glyph that is the WRONG one for that component (§9).

   HOW MUCH OF THAT IS ACTUALLY GATED — read the scope footer this prints at the
   end, not this paragraph. An earlier header claimed it "turns all three into
   pass/fail"; an audit showed §1 samples two element types, coverage is a floor
   rather than a check on correctness, and markup and STATES are not covered at
   all. That last gap is where the worst of the three historical defects lived,
   so the honest framing is: this narrows the gap, it does not close it.
   Exits non-zero on any finding, so it can gate a commit.

     (2) if the regex matched nothing at all, `mism` was empty and the section printed OK 0/0 and
         passed. One markup reformat in the guide would have turned it into a permanent green no-op.
         There is now a floor.
     (3) `unverifiable` only ever printed. The single entry most in need of a human look was the one
         waved through — and that is exactly where the "New chat" wrong-glyph hid.
     (4) the ±320-char window around EVERY occurrence of a label was so wide that "Settings" pulled in
         5 icons across 64 sites, and Write/Upload/Ask BlueAI shared one identical candidate set

   12. COMPONENT FAMILIES — components that share a treatment must share a RULE.
       The designer caught .bai-sched-newrow claiming (in a comment) to use
       ".bai-upload-row's house treatment" while alignment, padding, radius and
       gap had all silently diverged — a comment asserted sameness that nothing
       enforced. The fix expressed the family as one combined-selector rule; this
       section guards that fix: for each declared family, (a) the combined base
       rule must exist, and (b) no member's OWN rule may re-declare a family
       property, because an override is exactly how the drift would sneak back.
       Adding a member to a family here is a design decision — do it when a new
       component genuinely adopts an existing treatment, and let the base rule
       carry the shared look.
