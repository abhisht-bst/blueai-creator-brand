// The header's right-hand slot. Pulled out of Header.tsx on 2026-08-13 — that file was at 269 lines
// against this project's 300-line rule and this slot grew a third state, so it needed to be somewhere
// rather than pushing the header over.
//
// FIVE OUTCOMES now (brands grew its own pair on 2026-08-18, FE review: a returning brand had no
// Sign in and no way to see its active campaigns from this header):
//   · brands, out       → a quiet "Sign in" link + "Create a campaign". Both open the same campaign
//                         dialog, which opens at the sign-in gate while signed out; signing in from
//                         it lands on the campaigns dashboard (see ModalHost).
//   · brands, in        → "Create a campaign" + the brand account chip (BrandAccountMenu: the
//                         email, Your campaigns, Log out). The CTA stays, unlike the creators'
//                         signed-in state, because creating a campaign is not already on the page.
//   · creators, out     → "Apply Now", opens the sign-in dialog.
//   · creators, in      → the account chip. No CTA at all, because the action it would offer is
//                         already on the page: the application IS the top of the page once you're
//                         signed in, so a header button pointing at it competes with itself.
//
// The chip IS a menu now (designer, 2026-08-13): hover feedback on the trigger, and a click opens a
// popover carrying the account identity and Log out. It replaced an inert avatar+name row whose only
// route out of the signed-in state was the review-only PreviewToggler — which is fine for a reviewer
// and wrong for the flow being reviewed.
//
// THE TWO CTA BUTTONS ARE `hidden lg:...` NOW (2026-08-13) — MobileMenu.tsx is what shows below
// `lg`, carrying the same action inside its own popover alongside the nav row mobile never had.
// The AccountMenu branch is deliberately NOT hidden — it's compact enough to stay on screen at
// every width, and MobileMenu itself renders nothing in that state (see its own comment).
