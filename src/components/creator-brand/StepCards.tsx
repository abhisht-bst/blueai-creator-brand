/**
 * The steps as a row of large cards, revealed one at a time over a pinned title.
 *
 * SPLIT 2026-08-13. This file was 474 lines against the project's 300-line rule, and the creators
 * steps needed changing (three steps to four, plus a pending-art state). The numeral's SVG defs went
 * to stepcards/NumeralDefs.tsx and one card's markup to stepcards/StepCell.tsx; the plan is
 * byte-identical either side of the split for both pages, so it is a pure refactor. What stayed here
 * is the part that is genuinely this component's job: the beat structure and the pinning.
 *
 * The beat structure: the title arrives alone and holds; then card 1 lands on top of it, then card 2,
 * then card 3, each ACCUMULATING rather than replacing the last, and the title fades out across that
 * span so it's gone by the time the third card is in.
 *
 * HORIZONTAL SHIFT. Cards are a fixed width (see .cb-step-track), so a 4-up page's cards are the same
 * size as a 3-up page's rather than being squeezed to fit — which means the track can be wider than
 * the STAGE it sits in (.cb-step-viewport, pinned to a fixed 3-card width so both pages' card 1
 * starts at the same x — see that class for the bug this is fixing). When a card lands off-stage
 * right, the row slides left far enough to bring it in, and the card's own entrance is delayed until
 * that slide is mostly done, so you see the row make room and THEN the card arrive. The shift is
 * derived from measured geometry, not from the step count, so it is 0 whenever the row already fits
 * and needs no per-page config. Nothing here special-cases either page; it is the same measurement
 * either way — which is why the creators page going from three cards to four needed no change to this
 * file at all beyond the split.
 *
 * This is the pinned mechanism the earlier sequencer used, minus the thing that made that one
 * fragile. There, each beat REPLACED the previous one, so every transition was a handover between two
 * moving frames — which is where the pinType jitter, the `anticipatePin` entry jump, the
 * snap-vs-threshold tuning and the "two steps on screen after a fast gesture" race all lived. Here
 * nothing hands over: a card's target state is a pure function of how far you've scrolled, cards
 * never leave once shown, and the title is a scrubbed opacity with no movement at all. A fast gesture
 * can't strand anything, because there is no intermediate state to strand.
 *
 * Pinning is desktop-only and motion-safe-only, via `gsap.matchMedia`. Both branches render the SAME
 * DOM (the title switches from in-flow to absolutely-centred with a `lg:` variant, and the track
 * switches from a column to a row in CSS), so there's no `isPinned` state and no first-paint flash of
 * a different layout. The cards' hidden start state is `lg:motion-safe:opacity-0`, matching the
 * matchMedia query exactly — so wherever the script does NOT run, the cards are simply visible rather
 * than permanently invisible.

            .cb-step-viewport the STAGE — caps its own width at exactly a 3-card span and centres
                              THAT, not whatever the actual (3- or 4-card) track measures, which is
                              what makes card 1 land at the same x-position on both pages; crops
                              nothing itself any more
          Collapsing these into one element (as this was originally written) is what caused "card 1
          clipped from the left": with the crop on the SAME element that also insets the stage from
          the page (~140px), an outgoing card got guillotined mid-page, with ordinary page background
          sitting to the left of the cut — the crop landed at the stage's own edge, not the page's.
          See .cb-step-viewport in the CSS for the full account, including two earlier wrong turns
          (widening a clip-margin, then blaming the fade mask) before landing on relocating the
          boundary itself.

          .cb-step-clip is also horizontal-clip-only, for the SAME reason as before: the numerals hang
          ~96px ABOVE their cards, and clipping that vertically too would cut the one thing the hang
          exists to show. No scrollbar and nothing the user can drag out of sync, either — it just
          crops at the page edge instead of dragging one open.

          translate-y-10 is OPTICAL centring, and it is measured rather than eyeballed. The pin centres
          this box geometrically and does it correctly — the track lands at offsetTop 147 in a 958px
          pinned box, i.e. exactly (958 - 663) / 2. But the numerals are absolutely positioned, so they
          contribute no height while contributing plenty of visible mass: each digit's top edge sits
          80px above its card (96px offset less the 16px of slack between the SVG's top and the
          glyph's cap). That puts the composition's real visual centre 40px above the viewport's, which
          reads as top-aligned. Shifting down by half the overhang re-centres the mass.

          It goes on THIS element, not the track: GSAP owns the track's transform for the horizontal
          shift and an inline transform would overwrite a Tailwind translate class. Re-derive the 40px
          if the numeral's -top or size changes. */}

            // than the stage, and centring a wider box on itself pushes its start negative.
            // Flush-left means card 1 always starts at the same x on both pages; any extra width
