  // tracking-label is; it has to be measured per label and set as an inline style.
  //
  // Method: reset to letter-spacing:normal, measure the label's bare width, then distribute
  // (target - bare) across `length` gaps, not `length - 1`. Checked empirically rather than
  // assumed — a 6-character test string with letter-spacing:10px measured exactly 60px wider
  // than at letter-spacing:normal (60/6, not 60/5), meaning the browser adds the value after
  // EVERY character, the trailing one included. That's the same mechanism that made the
  // earlier chip version read as off-centre; here there's no container to be off-centre
  // within, so the trailing bit is harmless — it's just one more increment that has to be
  // counted for the total to land on `target` at all.
  //
  // TRACKING_EASE pulls the result in very slightly from an exact width match — asked for
  // after seeing the exact-fit version, which read as spread a hair too wide. It's a
  // multiplier on the per-gap value, not a flat px subtraction, specifically so it stays a
  // GENERAL rule rather than a "Brands" special case: a flat subtraction would shrink an
  // 8-letter word ("Creators") more in total than a 6-letter one ("Brands") for the same

  // their own trailing gap, instead of one page getting a hand-tuned number the other doesn't.

            What changed is everything to its right: wordmark and badge now share ONE column
            container (a second direct child of this same row), instead of the badge being a
            second row of the icon+wordmark block. Two consequences, both intended:
              1. items-center on THIS row centres the whole [wordmark, badge] column against
                 the icon's own 34px height, as one unit — not the icon centred against just
                 the wordmark the way it briefly was.
              2. The badge no longer needs ml-[42px] to fake alignment under the wordmark: it's
                 a plain sibling of the wordmark inside their own flex-col, so it's flush under
                 it by construction, no measured offset required. */}

                wordmark's width with no visual effect of its own. */}

                simpler version of just the label itself, sitting under the wordmark with
                nothing around it, was the better call. Everything that container needed is
                gone with it: the fit-content/centring math, the padding-vs-corner-radius
                balance, the two-span split (that one's specific to .text-gradient's own
                background-shorthand collision, which only mattered because there was a SECOND
                background — the fill — to collide with; a single span is free of it).

                text-[9px] leading-none keeps this line tight under the wordmark rather than
                inheriting the page's default line-height. -mt-px now, not mt-0 — 0 was already
                as close as two lines can get WITHOUT overlapping, so "closer still" has to mean
                a small deliberate overlap: -1px eats into the sliver of font-metric leading
                below the wordmark's own glyphs, not into the glyphs themselves.

                letterSpacing is inline, not a Tailwind class, because it's a MEASURED value
                (see the effect above) — spread wide enough that this label's own text spans
                the same width as the wordmark above it, computed fresh per label since
                "Brands" and "Creators" need different amounts to hit the same target. Falls
                back to tracking-label (the shared DS value) until the measurement resolves,
                so there's no unstyled flash on first paint.

                marginLeft: labelTracking * OPTICAL_SHIFT is the optical recentring that
                width-matching alone doesn't give you. The trailing letter-spacing increment
                (the same "browser adds it after the last character too" fact from the effect
                above) is empty space sitting only on the box's right, so the actual INK inside
                reads slightly left of true centre even once TRACKING_EASE has the box itself
                landing a hair narrower than the wordmark. Shifting the whole box right by a
                fraction of that one trailing increment moves the ink to where it visually
                belongs. Started at *0.5 (half); asked for a bit more, now *0.7 — still tied to
                the actual measured increment, not a fixed px nudge, so both labels move by the
                same proportion of their own trailing gap rather than one page getting a
                hand-tuned number the other doesn't. Skipped during the fallback render (no
                measured tracking yet) — same as the letter-spacing itself, it only applies once
                real geometry is known. */}
