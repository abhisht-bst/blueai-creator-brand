// ONE dialog primitive for all four of this site's popups (campaign form, pricing table, waitlist,
// handle lookup). Two visual variants because the site genuinely has two surfaces and the designer
// asked the waitlist popup to carry "the same grid lines and colors" as the closing band:
//
//   light — white card on the marketing DS. Forms and tables.
//   band  — the dark bg-cta-band + receding CTAGrid, i.e. CTABand's own treatment lifted into a
//           dialog. NOT a re-implementation: it renders the same CTAGrid component the section
//           does, so the grid can't drift between the two.
//
// PORTALS TO document.body, and that isn't optional here: both heroes are
// `overflow-hidden` sections (they crop their own edge cards), so a dialog rendered in the tree
// under a CTA that lives inside one would be clipped by it.
//
// THE OVERLAY SCROLLS, NOT THE PANEL. A panel with its own overflow-y:auto would clip the
// campaign form's date-picker and country dropdown the moment either opened near the panel's
// bottom edge — the exact problem blueai-desktop had to portal its picker out of a subpane to
// solve. Here the scroll container is the full-viewport overlay instead, so a popover only ever
// meets the viewport edge, which is the boundary its own flip logic already measures against.

  // shares `band`'s light-on-dark close button but NOT its CTAGrid — grid lines across a replica of

// The close button's geometry, shared with ModalHeader below. This pair is the whole reason the
// header exists as a component: the close button is absolutely positioned against the PANEL, while
// each dialog's header used to bring its own padding — so whether the glyph lined up with the title
// was luck, and it didn't (the earnings dialog's 13px title sat ~6px above the glyph's centre).
//
// Both now use the same two numbers: a CLOSE_BOX-tall row at CLOSE_INSET from the top. The title
// row centres its content in that box, so the glyph and the title share a centre line at
// CLOSE_INSET + CLOSE_BOX/2 whatever size the title text is — 13px handle or 20px heading.
const CLOSE_INSET = 'top-2.5' // 10px
const CLOSE_BOX = 'h-11 w-11' //  44px, the touch minimum. Was 36 — fine for a mouse, 8px short for
//                                a thumb, on the one control every dialog relies on to get out.

/**
 * The header row for light dialogs: a title line that lines up with the close button, and an
 * optional subtitle under it. Four dialogs were hand-writing this with three different paddings and
 * two different subtitle sizes; the alignment bug was only the visible half of that.
 *
 * pr-14 (56px) clears the close button's own 14px inset + 36px box on every breakpoint. The old
 * headers used pr-12 (48px) below sm, which left 2px of overlap.
