import { EARNING } from './mockData'

// The static explainer band: how the money works (three steps) and the payout rules, one card, not
// two. All of this is prose that never changes.
//
// VERTICAL LISTS IN A FULL-WIDTH BAND (2026-08-18, two rounds of direct feedback). Round one killed
// the tall card sitting BESIDE Transactions (a growing list and fixed prose can never agree on a
// height); round two killed the horizontal replacement, steps as three columns and rules as a
// dot-separated strip ("not a fan of horizontal lists, can u make them vertical"). So: the band
// stays full width below Transactions, and inside it the steps and the rules are BOTH vertical
// lists, sharing the width as two halves. That works here for the same reason the Transactions
// pairing failed: both halves are fixed prose of similar length, so neither leaves a dead zone
// under the other.
//
// COPY DECISIONS (2026-08-18, with the PM):
// - "Moneymaker" is written as a plain feature name with an everyday verb ("turn on"), never "the
//   Moneymaker skill": "skill" is BlueAI's internal vocabulary and this page's readers haven't
//   installed the product yet.
// - "automatically" is BANNED from this copy (PM, 2026-08-18: "we cant say automatically"), which is
//   also why the marketing step 4's phrasing is not quoted verbatim here any more. Do not sneak a
//   synonym in ("on its own", "hands-free", "while you sleep") — the directive is about the claim,
//   not the word.
// - Step 3 names the real numbers (20 days, $30) instead of "qualify for a payment": the card exists
//   to answer "how is my payment calculated", and an answer without the numbers isn't one.
// - The $30 is the PM's own figure from the marketing page's step 4 (HowItWorks.tsx).

// Terse on purpose, and nothing here the cash-out modal doesn't already promise: the 7-10 business
// days and the finality are quoted from its confirmation copy, so the rules list and the modal can
// never disagree about what happens to a withdrawal.
