// THE final call. Was WaitlistCTA — "The jobs open soon. / Be first in line." over an email-capture
// field — replaced per the PM (screenshot item 8): the CTA is "Apply now".
//
// The email field is gone with the waitlist, not relocated: the application asks for a contact email
// as its own question, so capturing one here would collect the same address twice through two
// different forms, and the one collected here would be attached to nothing.
//
// THE TWO BIG NUMBERS ARE GONE TOO ("Join 12,400+ creators waiting…"). They were invented figures, and
// their companions — the 12,400+/3,100+ stat panel — lived in the trust section the PM removed. A
// social-proof count on a pre-launch pilot page is a claim the product cannot back, and it was the
// last one left on the page.
//
// idPrefix: the submitted application's confirmation is ALSO a CTABand (ApplyForm.tsx), and both can
// be on the page at once. See CTAGrid.tsx for why duplicate SVG ids render correctly right up until
// they don't.

  // NOT RENDERED WHEN SIGNED IN (designer, 2026-08-13). This band's whole job is to ask someone to
  // apply; once they are signed in the application is already open at the top of the page, so a
  // closing "Apply now" is re-pitching a decision that has been made — and its button would only
  // scroll them back up to the form they are in the middle of. The page simply ends on the FAQ, which
  // is the right last word for someone half-way through filling it in.
  //
  // Returning null rather than swapping in a "finish your application" band: that would be a second
  // entry point to one form, and the same argument that removed the hero's earnings pill applies.
