// FOUR steps now, not three, and the copy is the PM's own (2026-08-13): Apply → Get selected → Set up
// BlueAI → Earn. That replaces a three-card set describing a per-job loop (accept a job → BlueAI
// handles it → get paid, on repeat) which the current model no longer has — this is a program you
// apply to once, not a queue you pick from.
//
// ART: the v3 set, delivered 2026-08-13, one file per step and named to these steps. It replaced both
// the placeholder panels this file briefly rendered AND the v2 set, which drew the engagement
// mechanics as labelled icons (an eye, a heart, a speech bubble, a repost arrow) — the reason the
// brief ruled it out. Checked before wiring: v3 draws none of those, and carries no baked text, no
// numbers and no logos, which is the other standing rule for this art.
//
// STEP 4 IS THE ONE EXCEPTION (designer, 2026-08-13, Appy's own call) — its art was swapped for a
// reference image that DOES bake in a "$30" numeral and checkmark badges, explicitly choosing to
// break from the no-baked-numbers rule above because it directly reinforces the copy sitting right
// next to it. Flagged before wiring, kept anyway. If this set is ever regenerated end-to-end, decide
// then whether step 4 rejoins the no-baked-content rule or the other three follow it.
//
// WebP q90, not the supplied PNGs: 7.24 MB -> 0.494 MB across the four, at 40.8-42.3 dB PSNR (above
// ~40 dB is visually indistinguishable on smooth gradient art like this). Step 4's replacement measures
// lower (32.7 dB) because that figure also captures a deliberate background retone, not just
// compression — see below. The PNG originals are preserved in design-source/creator-brand-art/.
//
// Backgrounds measured before use, per this project's rule about not reaching for a blend mode until
// you have: all four sit 7.0-8.4 units below the card's white at the top edge, within 1.4 units of
// each other. Full-bleed against the card's own edge with the existing hairline under them, so that
// tone reads as the media panel's — there is no inset box to betray it and nothing to correct.
// Step 4's replacement measured ~253 (near pure white, ~6 units off its siblings) straight out of the
// box, so it got the same linear per-channel retone the hero used once (see that README), targeting
// 248 to land back in the sibling range rather than reading as a brighter panel in the row.
//
// COPY LENGTHS ARE THE PM'S, UNBALANCED ON PURPOSE. This project's convention is that sibling bodies
// sit within ~10 characters of each other so they wrap to the same line count; these run 65 / 57 / 95
// / 84 (step 4 shortened 2026-08-13 — "at the end of each month" removed per the PM, the same clause
// dropped from the step 5 PayPal hint in the application), so cards 1 and 2 will show some dead space
// below their bodies where 3 and 4 fill it. Left exactly as written rather than quietly trimmed or
// padded — the words are the PM's to change, and a balanced variant is offered separately.
//
// The only edits made to the given strings: a full stop on step 1 (the other three have one), and the
// last two words of each body joined by a literal non-breaking space so no body ends on a stranded
// word. Both are this file's existing typographic conventions, not copy decisions. Grep the NBSPs
// with: grep -P '\xc2\xa0' HowItWorks.tsx
