// The signed-in account control in the header: a minimal trigger that opens a popover menu with Log
// out. Structure and behaviour follow blueai-desktop's kebab menu, which the designer named as the
// reference (read-only — nothing in that tree was touched, and this is not a VDA pass).
//
// WHAT WAS BORROWED, and the numbers are that file's, translated from its dark shell to this light
// marketing surface rather than copied as literals:
//   · TRIGGER HOVER. `.bai-icbtn` is a bare transparent control that grows a background on hover
//     (`background: var(--bai-pill)`) and lifts its icon colour to `--bai-text-hi`, over
//     `transition: background/color var(--bai-t-150)`. Here that is --cb-hover + ink-heading at
//     150ms. The previous version of this chip had NO hover state at all, which is what made it read
//     as a label rather than a control.
//   · OFFSET. `.bai-menu` sits at `calc(100% + 6px)` from its trigger. Same 6px here — but TOP, not
//     bottom: that menu opens upward because it lives at the bottom of the app window, and this one
//     hangs off a sticky header at the top of the page. The offset is the borrowed part, not the
//     direction.
//   · SURFACE. Panel background + 1px hairline + radius + a soft drop shadow + 4px of padding, with
//     ~2px between items — `.bai-menu`'s own recipe.
//   · ITEM HOVER. `.bai-menu-item:hover { background: var(--bai-hover-acc) }` — every row is a full
//     hover target with its own rounding inside the panel's padding, not bare text.
//
// The chip is deliberately NOT a card, a pill with a border, or a CTA: in blueai-desktop the account
// control is the quietest thing in its row, and it earns its presence on hover. Same here — over the
// hero it must not compete with the page's own primary action.
