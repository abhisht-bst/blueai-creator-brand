// The now.gg sign-in card, rebuilt from the real page's own computed styles and assets.
//
// SCRAPED, NOT EYEBALLED (2026-08-13, designer authority — "its mine only"). Every number below came
// off now.gg/accounts/auth/v1/identifier via getComputedStyle at the card's real 360px width, and the
// logos and provider icons are the actual files from cdn.now.gg, saved under
// public/creator-brand/nowgg-signin/. The previous version of this file was a likeness built from a
// screenshot and it was wrong in ways a screenshot cannot show: the typeface is POPPINS (not this
// site's Inter/Space Grotesk), the card is a dark panel with a 0.8px
// #7B4CFF ring — not the warm brown it looked like — and the header is TWO translucent gradient wave
// SVGs layered over that glass rather than a solid gradient strip.
//
// The measured spec, so nobody has to re-scrape to check a value:
//   card        360px wide · radius 12 · 0.8px solid #7B4CFF · overflow hidden. Ours is a SOLID
//               dark grey with NO backdrop blur (scraped: translucent black + blur) — see CARD_BG.
//   waves       360x135 @ opacity .4 and 360x123 @ opacity .5, both #7B4CFF -> #0EA4C5, second
//               reversed · header block 110px tall, 16px below it
//   "One account for"   Poppins 12/18 · 400 · #fff · padding 16 0 8
//   logos row   gap 18 · BlueStacks mark 42x38 + wordmark 75x13 at gap 10.84 · a 1x35 vertical
//               gradient rule (transparent -> rgba(255,255,255,.4) -> transparent) · now.gg 122x37
//   heading     Poppins 20/30 · 600 · #fff
//   sub-heading Poppins 14/21 · 400 · rgba(255,255,255,.7) at opacity .9 · 8 above
//   field label 10 · 600 · +1.5px tracking · uppercase · rgba(255,255,255,.8) · 4 above its input
//   input       14/21 · 400 · #fff · bg rgba(0,0,0,.2) · radius 8 · 0.8px rgba(255,255,255,.5) ·
//               shadow 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,.04) · padding 8 16
//   Continue    14/21 · 600 · linear-gradient(270deg,#7B4CFF 0%,#0EA4C5 99.48%) · radius 8 ·
//               padding 6 24 · 41px tall
//   separator   row gap 16 · rule + "Or sign in with" at 14/14 · 400 · rgba(255,255,255,.4)

//               Discord #8061FF, Facebook #2178FA
//   legal       12/18 · 400 · #fff · links underlined, same colour
//   form gaps   16 between blocks, 4 between a label and its input, 24 horizontal padding
//
// STILL NOT A REAL LOGIN, and it must never become one. There is no auth behind this: the email
// field collects nothing, has no name/autoComplete, and posts nowhere. Every control lands on the
// same prototype sign-in so a reviewer can't dead-end on a button that looks operable.
// SOLID DARK GREY, NO BLUR (designer, 2026-08-13). The scrape's card is glass — rgba(0,0,0,0.7) over
// rgba(0,0,0,0.2) with backdrop-blur(32px) — and chasing that is the one thing here that went a long
// way round, so the conclusion is worth keeping:
//
// The blur was never visible, because Modal's shared scrim (58% + its own 3px blur) sits between this
// card and the page, and a backdrop-filter can only reveal what is behind it. The fix on offer was to
// lighten the scrim for this dialog alone. It worked, and it was the wrong trade — the overlay belongs
// to the SITE, so a creators dialog dimming the page differently from a brands dialog breaks a
// consistency a visitor feels without being able to name. The scrim went back; the blur went instead.
//
// Solid rather than any alpha, then: a translucent card's read changes with whatever page is behind
// it, and a solid one is the same card every time. It also closes this thread for good — nothing to
// see through means nothing to blur and no reason to touch the shared overlay again.

            into the wave and merged with it.
            The waves are 135px and 123px SVGs whose bottom curves run to roughly y=96-135 depending
            on x, so any header shorter than 135 lets the heading overlap them somewhere across the
            card's width. Matching the taller SVG makes the clearance structural rather than tuned:
            content can never collide with a wave, and the body's own 16px gap below is then real
            separation instead of the last 16px of an overlap. Re-derive from Waves() if either SVG's
