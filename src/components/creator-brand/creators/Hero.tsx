// Slim proof-point cards, scattered near the hero's edges (same device as the social-rewards
// hero's Reddit-post collage). Quiet by default (low opacity, hairline border) — on hover each
// one comes forward: full opacity, a touch bigger, and a little extra tilt.
//
// REWRITTEN 2026-08-13 against the PM's model, and this was not a copy-polish pass — five of the ten
// had become false statements. The old set promised per-job consent ("Skip or decline any job,
// anytime", "Take on as many jobs as you want", "See what a job pays before you accept"), narrated
// the engagement mechanic the brief removes ("You approve every comment before it posts"), and got
// the payment terms wrong ("Get paid within days of it clearing" — it is PayPal, monthly). The PM's
// list never mentioned these cards, because they are low-opacity decoration at the hero's edges; a
// decorative card still makes a claim, so leaving them would have left five of them lying. Every
// line below traces to something in the brief: the four How It Works steps, or an FAQ answer.

                ~190-220px sliver — technically visible, but too small to read as the hero it's meant to

                not the same photo resized.
                A real <picture>, not two next/image elements toggled by Tailwind display classes: this
                route sets images.unoptimized in next.config, so next/image gives no resizing benefit
                here anyway — and a CSS-hidden <img> still gets FETCHED by the browser regardless of
                display:none, so hiding one of two <Image>s would still ship both hero images to every
                visitor. <picture>'s <source media> is the one mechanism that only downloads the asset
                that will actually render.
                The wrapper's own aspect-ratio switches at the same breakpoint the <source> does
                (aspect-[1086/1448] below sm, aspect-[1672/941] at sm+), so the box is reserved correctly

                // 1. THE SUBJECT AGAINST THE FRAME (v3). v3 ran the subject and a shelving unit hard

                //    visible vertical step where her arm simply stopped. heroImageMask.ts leaves the
                //    side edges at ~0.69 alpha deliberately and says why: the side delta measured only
                //    1-3 units on the assets it was tuned against. So v3 broke the mask's premise; it
                //    did not reveal a mask bug. Tightening rx would have moved the brands hero too (the
                //    mask is shared) and faded the subject further in. Fixed by the ASSET insetting its
                //    subject, from v4 on.
                //
                // 2. THE BACKGROUND AGAINST THE PAGE (v4 and v5 both). Both arrived with a ~253
                //    background against this route's 249/249/250 page, and the designer reported white
                //    bands down the left and right edges. The mask cannot help: horizontally its alpha
                //    bottoms out at 0.686 and NEVER reaches 0, so a background brighter than the page
                //    stays at least 69% present all the way out. Vertically ry=52% DOES reach 0, which
                //    is exactly why only the sides showed it. layout.tsx's page colour was SAMPLED from
                //    the original artwork, so any new asset with a different background breaks the
                //    premise the whole no-seam system rests on.
                //    Fixed in the ASSET: a linear per-channel scale (measured bg -> page colour, 0 -> 0)
                //    baked into the WebP, landing the background on the page exactly and darkening
                //    everything else by a uniform 1.47%. v5's edge delta went +3.0 -> -0.23 / -1.46.
                //    NOT a blend mode — a multiply on an asset BRIGHTER than the page manufactures the
                //    very seam it gets reached for, the mistake already on record in blueai/CLAUDE.md.
                //    NOT the mask — shared with the brands hero, whose own background measures -0.86 at
