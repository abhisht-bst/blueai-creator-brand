// "ENGAGEMENT JOBS" IS GONE (PM, 2026-08-13, screenshot item 6). It appeared twice — on YouTube and on
// Reddit — and it is the one phrase on this site that names the thing outright. The unit is still a
// "job" (the PM's own FAQ calls it that); what cannot be said is what kind. "Brand campaigns" is the
// replacement, matching the hero's sub-headline and step 4.
//
// Reddit lost its whole sentence rather than having "engagement" swapped out of it, because the other
// three "soon" cards say what the format IS ("Reels and posts", "Any clip that hits the brief",
// "Threads and posts") and Reddit was the odd one out saying what the work is. It now describes a
// format like its neighbours. "Comments" is deliberately not that format, for the same reason the
// phrase above went.
