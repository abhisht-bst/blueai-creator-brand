// The application's option sets, split out of Steps.tsx to keep that file under this project's
// 300-line rule. Data plus the glyph each option carries — no behaviour.
//
// CARDS vs CHIPS is decided per QUESTION, and option COUNT is very much part of that call, not
// separate from it (revised 2026-08-13 — the line this replaced said the opposite, and it was wrong in
// a way that cost a real bug: DESCRIBES_OPTS spent months as `variant="cards"` on the theory that "who
// you are" deserves the weight, and five options stacked one-per-row on mobile made step 1 the single
// tallest step in the form, next to step 2's ~220px with nothing yet answered — a gap no min-height
// floor can close, since a floor pads a shorter step up and cannot shrink a taller one down.
// The rule that actually holds: cards for a SHORT list (two, maybe three) where full weight per option
// is affordable — hasYouTube is the one left in this file — chips for anything longer, REGARDLESS of
// how much the question matters. Five mostly one-word options (Student, Employed, Freelancer, Other)
// is "the small factual ones... where a card row would inflate three words into a wall" (ChoiceGroup.tsx's
// own phrase for yes/no) just as much as a two-item question is — it was simply never named as the
// same case.
//
// The hints under the channel options are doing real work, not decoration: they answer the "wait,
// does this disqualify me?" beat at the exact moment it lands, which is otherwise a question somebody
// leaves the form to go and answer.

// The two capacity questions that replaced "Why do you want to join?" (PM, 2026-08-14) — see
// StepThree for the reasoning. Fixed ranges rather than a free number field: typed numbers come back
// as "depends", "8-16?" and "all day lol", and ranges make applications sortable at review time.
// ALL UNTONED, deliberately: green on the high answers would tell the applicant which answer the
// reviewer wants, and a self-reported capacity question is leading enough already. (FULL_RUN's tones
// are different in kind — yes/no carries real affirm/deny semantics; "more" does not mean "correct".)
