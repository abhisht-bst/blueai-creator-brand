/**
 * The receding grid on the dark closing-CTA bands — floor and ceiling.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SVG AND NOT CSS 3D. It was `perspective` + `rotateX` on two background-gradient
 * planes, and that failed three times for the same underlying reason: with a 3D rotation, where
 * the paint actually lands is a non-linear function of the plane's height, the angle, the
 * perspective distance AND the band's own height — so every value had to be guessed, and each
 * guess broke a different axis:
 *
 *   1. rotateX squashes the plane's vertical axis by cos(angle). At 78° that's 0.21, so the
 *      HORIZONTAL lines (whose thickness lives on that axis) rendered 1px as 0.21px and all but
 *      disappeared, while the verticals kept a full 1px. They looked like two different grids.
 *   2. Thickening the horizontals to 5px fixed their weight but a 132px row pitch left only
 *      ~2 rows in a 310px plane — two stripes, not a grid.
 *   3. Deepening the plane to 160% to win rows back made each plane 619px inside a 387px band,
 *      so the floor and ceiling boxes overlapped through the middle and ruled lines straight
 *      across the copy.
 *
 * Here every line's endpoints are computed, so the geometry is exact and checkable, and both
 * axes take the same 1px stroke because nothing is foreshortened. `preserveAspectRatio="none"`
 * means the result no longer depends on the band's measured height at all.

/**
 * `idPrefix` exists because there can now be TWO of these in one document at once: the closing
 * band's, and the waitlist dialog's (Modal.tsx variant="band"). The gradient and mask ids used to
 * be static strings, so a second instance duplicated four ids and every `url(#…)` in it resolved
 * to the FIRST instance's definitions. That happens to render correctly here — both instances share
 * the same viewBox and userSpaceOnUse geometry, so the borrowed mask lands in exactly the right
 * place — which is precisely why it would have gone unnoticed until someone changed one band's
 * dimensions and broke the other. A prop rather than useId(): this is otherwise a pure-markup
 * server component, and adding a hook would ship it to the client for an id.
