    // Rewritten 2026-08-13 with the creators-side model change. Was "Thousands of waitlisted
    // accounts pick up your campaign themselves." Two things were wrong and only one was the word:
    // there is no waitlist to be on any more (creators APPLY and are selected), and "pick up your
    // campaign themselves" asserted per-job creator consent, which the new model removed outright —
    // creators are approved into a program and BlueAI runs campaigns on their account. A brands page
    // describing the creators journey wrongly is worse than a stale word, because the page that
    // contradicts it is one click away in this same footer.
    //
    // "No outreach from you" is kept verbatim: it was the only part carrying a brand benefit, and at
    // 87 characters the replacement holds this body's line count against its three siblings.

    // form brings this, the longest of the four, down to their line count.
    // CHANGED 2026-08-13, and this is the one on this page with commercial substance rather than
    // stale wording. It said "Each creator genuinely engages with your video" — which tells an
    // advertiser the creator personally does the engaging. The creators page one click away now says
    // the opposite in plain terms: "BlueAI completes brand campaigns on your behalf", running on the
    // creator's own computer. Both pages cannot be right, and the brands page was the wrong one.
    //
    // What the sentence is FOR is preserved deliberately: "real" (a real person's account, not a
    // farm) and "verified" (nothing counts until it is checked) are the two reassurances a brand
    // actually buys, and neither depended on the creator doing the clicking themselves. 93
    // characters against the sibling at 94, so the four bodies still wrap to the same line count.
