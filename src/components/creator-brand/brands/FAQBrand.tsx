// and the last two words of each answer are joined by a literal non-breaking space so an
// answer can't end on one stranded word.

  {
    q: 'Does creating a campaign cost anything?',
    a: 'No. Creating a campaign only defines the terms. Your budget is only ever spent against engagement that BlueAI actually verifies.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What exactly does a creator do?',
    a: 'They genuinely engage with your YouTube video, and BlueAI verifies every one before it counts against your budget.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is this only for YouTube?',
    a: 'For now, yes. YouTube campaigns are live today, and Instagram, TikTok, X, and Reddit are coming soon.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What stops a creator from faking it?',
    a: 'BlueAI checks every single interaction directly. Anything that doesn’t meet the bar simply doesn’t get paid.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I run more than one campaign at a time?',
    a: 'Yes. Each campaign has its own budget and window, so you can run several in parallel.',
  },
