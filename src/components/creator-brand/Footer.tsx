// stays exactly where it was designed. The lists drop their space-y to compensate, so the visual
// rhythm is unchanged and only the hit area grows. Below sm the three columns stack into one strip,
// which is what made ~19px targets at 10px spacing the densest tap region on either page.

/**
 * Rebuilt from a single centered line (logo · tagline · copyright) into a proper wayfinding
 * footer. The old version had nothing wrong with its spacing — the problem was that it had
 * only ONE job (a trust stamp) when a footer's real job on a two-page site is to get someone
 * who scrolled all the way down to either page they might want.
 *
 * No CTA band here, deliberately: both pages already end on one directly above this
 * (WaitlistCTA / ClosingCTA) — a second big gradient pill here would be re-pitching the same
 * offer a third time on the same scroll. This footer's links are the quieter kind: jump to a
 * section on THIS page, or go read the OTHER audience's page, or go back to the top. Every
 * href is a real anchor that exists on this page today (grepped from the section `id`s under
 * creators/ and brands/) or the other real route — nothing here points at a page that doesn't
 * exist, the same rule the rest of this site holds copy to.
