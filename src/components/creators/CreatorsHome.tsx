  // invisible header. This effect re-adds revealed+settled after that cleanup runs (React runs all
  // passive destroys before creates in a commit, so the ordering is guaranteed), and removes them
  // when signing out so the remounting intro starts from its un-revealed baseline and replays —
  // a signed-out visitor gets the homepage's full entrance, which is the honest state to return to.
