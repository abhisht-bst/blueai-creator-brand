// The closing CTA's grid-lined band — a COPY of creator-brand's CTABand + CTAGrid pair (Appy,
// 2026-08-19: "the final CTA call style can be similar to what we have there, inside a grid lined
// container same bg same grids"), now carrying blueai-product's MoneyMaker shine on top of it
// (Appy, 2026-08-20: "that same grid lines animation... everything same way"). Both are copies,
// not imports: /creator-brand is frozen, and blueai-product's version is a plain-browser JSX
// bundle in another worktree.
//
// TWO DELIBERATE DEVIATIONS from the original geometry, both Appy's and both noted where they live:
//   · the band GRADIENT is rebuilt from this page's tokens (creators.css .crx-band) — the DS's own
//     colours read as a panel borrowed from another site when dropped on this sky;
//   · NEAR_INSET pulls both planes off the band's edges, so the first row is not mistaken for a
//     border stroke.
// Everything else is the original constant for constant — a receding floor and ceiling drawn as
// two vanishing-point fans. Its own notes, worth keeping because they explain non-obvious values:
//   · SPREAD is wider than the viewBox so the fan fills the band instead of tapering inside it.
//   · rowOffsets are non-linear (RATIO) so rows bunch toward the horizon the way perspective does.
//   · Each plane is masked to dissolve BEFORE its own horizon — otherwise the rows pile into a
//     hard vanishing line. Three gradient stops, not two, so most of the falloff lands in the
//     first third and the grid is already fading well before FADE_END.
//
// BASE STROKES ARE currentColor, not the original's hardcoded #fff — the band went light (see
// creators.css .crx-band), and white lines on a white panel are invisible. The colour is set once
// on the svg in CSS, so the grid follows the band whichever way it is themed. The SHINE keeps its
// literal iris/cyan, because that layer IS the logo gradient and must not follow the theme.
//
// One band on this page, so the SVG ids need no prefix parameter — the original takes one because
// the creators page could render two at once (the submitted-application confirmation and the
// closing band), and duplicate mask ids render correctly right up until one band's size changes.

// NEAR_INSET is this copy's one deviation from the original geometry (Appy, 2026-08-19), and it
// went 16 -> 6 -> -8 to land. The original starts each plane exactly on the band's edge, where the
// first row (offset 0) reads as an extra hairline stroke against the rounded corner rather than as
// the start of a floor. A POSITIVE inset pulls the plane inward, which fixes the stroke but opens
// a visible dead gap and loses the sense of the grid running into the band.
// NEGATIVE is the better answer: the plane's near edge sits 8 units OUTSIDE the frame, so the
// offset-0 row is clipped away by overflow:hidden and the first row you actually see is the second
// one — already in perspective, and closer to the edge than any positive inset could put it.
// The masks follow it below, so the fade still spans exactly near -> horizon.

// SHINE, ported constant for constant from blueai-product's moneymaker_backdrop.jsx (MMGrid).
// A traveling wave of the logo's iris->cyan gradient, drawn as a second, thicker line layer over
// the base grid, transparent at rest and full at its peak, scrolling from the horizon toward the
// viewer on each plane. TILE is the gradient's repeat period; FAST is how long the streak takes to
// cross a fixed point and GAP is the quiet between waves, so a point flashes for FAST and sits
// dark for GAP of every DUR.
// FASTER HERE THAN IN THE ORIGINAL (Appy, 2026-08-20: "decrease the time difference between grid
// line animations here, can be a bit faster, only here"). MoneyMaker runs 0.9/2.5; that panel is a
// persistent app backdrop you sit in front of for minutes, where a long quiet is what keeps it from
// nagging. This band is one screen you scroll past, so a 2.5s dark stretch means most visitors see
// the grid do nothing at all. The pulse itself is barely quicker — it is the GAP that shortens.

// synced to the gradient's own DUR (moneymaker's own range is 1-3; Appy widened it here on
// 2026-08-20, because against this band's shorter cycle one or two lit lines read as a stray
// glimmer rather than a sweep) — while the TIMING stays on one shared clock, so the whole grid
// genuinely goes dark together between waves. That combination is the one part of the effect that
// needs JS: a single shared gradient can only ever paint the same lines every repeat (nothing about
// a periodic animation changes between its own cycles), and per-line independent phases trade the
// guaranteed gap away, since 15 clocks means something is always mid-flash somewhere.
