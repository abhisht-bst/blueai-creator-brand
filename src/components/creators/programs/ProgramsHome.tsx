// "Pick a program to apply to" picker. THE REFRAME (2026-08-24 review, Abhisht): the post-login
// screen answers "where do I stand?", not "which one do you want?" — a picker is embarrassing with
// one program (a menu of one) and this screen has to exist in four states regardless of how many
// programs are open. Three of those states live here (open / pending / none); enrolled is the
// dashboard journey and stays its own view.
//
// ONE RICH CARD, NOT A LIST ROW: with a single program at launch, a bare title+price row reads as
// a broken list. The card carries everything the dev build buries a click deeper (reward, what the
// AI does, spots, end date) so applying starts from an informed place — and when N>1 the same card
// repeats and the screen is already a picker.
//
// THE COMING-SOON GHOST under the card is what makes this screen's existence self-explanatory at
// N=1: it pre-trains the reader that programs are the unit of this product (same pattern as the old
// landing's YouTube LIVE / Instagram SOON row) without inventing fake program names that would
// read as promises.
//
// PAYOUT COPY RULE (meeting note 4 + 5): money is paid when the PROGRAM ENDS, not monthly — and
// the word is "earn"/"paid", never "payout" (ops vocabulary). Every money line here says so; if
// the model changes, this file and StepIntro are where the copy lives.
