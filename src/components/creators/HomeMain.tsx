// Above-the-fold markup: the ambient pixel rain, the hero copy + CTA, the machine stage, and the
// hero. Ported 1:1 from the mock (alt-copy.html) EXCEPT the stage — the mock's CSS-drawn desk and
// laptop were replaced on 2026-08-19 by a rotating photoreal machine stage — and then restored on
// 2026-08-20 when that stage moved to the sleep section, where it has since been replaced in turn
// by a single still. This scene is the page's only animated device now. The
// fleet section that used to follow the hero here was cut on 2026-08-20. Pure markup either
// way: every behaviour
// (task lifecycle, earnings credit, chip flights) lives in useHomeFx.ts, which mutates nodes by id.
// React never re-renders this subtree, which is what makes that direct mutation safe.
