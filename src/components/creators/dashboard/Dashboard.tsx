// working screen, not the page's centered pitch copy.

// No ambient animation imported here on purpose (the light original dropped its PixelRain for the
// same reason): a dashboard someone checks routinely is a working screen, not a pitch, and animated
// noise under real numbers reads as noise rather than mood.

          history routinely, the explainer is read once. The band gap matches the stat grid's gap so
