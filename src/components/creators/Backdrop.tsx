// The room the page sits in — one fixed layer of three drifting orbs and the logo's own star,
// behind every section. A COPY of creator-brand's Backdrop.tsx (Appy, 2026-08-20: "the same orbs
// and sparkle that we used in the creator website... they didn't appear in the hero, but when you
// scroll it appeared from the second section, it used to fade in"). Copied, not imported: that
// tree is frozen.
//
// THE HERO IS OFF LIMITS, which is the whole behaviour Appy is describing. The layer holds at
// opacity 0 for the entire hero and fades in as the hero leaves — measured off the hero's real
// height rather than a guessed scroll distance, because that height is not the same on a laptop
// as on a phone. Atmosphere behind the first thing a reader has to read is atmosphere in the way.
//
// HAND-ROLLED, NOT framer-motion. The original drives every value through useTransform, and
// framer-motion is installed here — but nothing on /creators imports it, and this route's whole
// idiom is hand-rolled motion for exactly this reason (PixelRain, useScrollReveal, the boot
// intro, the machine loop). One scroll-linked layer is not worth being the reason a ~50kB client
// dependency lands on the route.
//
// ONE rAF-COALESCED SCROLL LISTENER writes all four elements. Scroll fires far more often than
// frames do, so doing the maths per event would compute values nobody ever sees; the flag means
// at most one write per frame no matter how fast the wheel spins.
//
// HOMEPAGE ONLY (mounted in HomepageView, not CreatorsHome). The application, dashboard and
// full-capacity views are working surfaces — a drifting colour field behind a form is noise, and
// their own container already carries the page's atmosphere.
