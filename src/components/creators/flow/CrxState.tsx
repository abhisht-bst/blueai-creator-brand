// /creators' signed-in state + the mock now.gg account behind it. Copied from the frozen
// creator-brand tree's ApplyState.tsx (never imported — that tree is read-only reference), with the
// storage keys re-namespaced to 'crx-*' so the two prototypes can't clobber each other's session.
//
// WHY A CONTEXT ABOVE THE PAGE'S SUBTREES: the header (account chip vs CTA), the top of the page
// (hero vs application/dashboard/notice) and the closing band all need the same answer at once.
//
// SESSION-BACKED, not local-backed: a reviewer reloads constantly, and being thrown to signed-out
// every reload makes the signed-in half tedious to reach. sessionStorage so closing the tab resets —
// a handoff prototype that remembers you for a week is one nobody sees the entry flow of.
//
// FIRST PAINT IS ALWAYS SIGNED OUT; stored values apply in an effect (ready flips true after).
// Reading storage during render makes server HTML and the client's first render disagree — a
// hydration error — and signed-out is the honest default for a fresh visitor anyway.
const KEY = 'crx-signed-in'
// `journey` answers a DIFFERENT question than `signedIn`: signedIn is "did they click through the
// sign-in dialog"; journey is "when they do, which of three accounts does it turn out to be" — a
// first-time applicant, a creator already earning, or someone arriving while BlueAI is full.
// THE HARD-WON RULE (creator-brand, 2026-08-14 fix): journey must NEVER be checked without signedIn
// alongside it. An earlier version let the equivalent flag take priority OVER signedIn and skip
// sign-in entirely — so signOut() (which only clears signedIn) couldn't undo it, and Log out from
// the dashboard did nothing. signedIn gates first, everywhere; journey only picks WHICH signed-in view.
const JOURNEY_KEY = 'crx-journey'
// Journeys added for the programs home (2026-08-24, Abhisht's program-workflow pass):
// 'applied' — signed in, application submitted, review underway; 'noPrograms' — signed in while
// nothing is open to apply to; 'multiPrograms' — the open home with SEVERAL programs accepting
// applications at once (same view as newUser, more inventory — a state ops will reach the day a
// second program activates, so the review kit has to show it). 'newUser' lands on the open home
// with the single launch program.
// 'appliedMulti' / 'enrolledMulti' (2026-08-24): the mixed homes — one program in review (or
// already active) while others stay open to apply to. 'returningUser' is the LAUNCH returning
// member (dashboard with the one creators program); 'returningMulti' is the future one (dashboard
// with several). The one-program journeys are the going-live set (2026-08-24 meeting).
