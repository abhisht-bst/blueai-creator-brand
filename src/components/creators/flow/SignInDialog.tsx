// COPIED near-verbatim from the frozen creator-brand tree's creators/SignInDialog.tsx (read-only
// reference, never imported) — designer directive: "the sign in pop up will remain the same". Three
// changes only: useCrx replaces useApply, the root carries its own w-full max-w-[360px] (the frozen
// Modal's size="xs" used to supply it; this page's Modal is an unsized slot), and this header note.
// Everything below — waves, measured paddings, provider buttons, legal line — is byte-faithful,
// Tailwind classes included: this card is a self-contained replica of now.gg's own screen, not a
// kit consumer, so the page's no-Tailwind convention deliberately does not apply inside it.
//
// The now.gg sign-in card, rebuilt from the real page's own computed styles and assets.
//
// SCRAPED, NOT EYEBALLED (2026-08-13, designer authority — "its mine only"). Every number below came
// off now.gg/accounts/auth/v1/identifier via getComputedStyle at the card's real 360px width, and the
// logos and provider icons are the actual files from cdn.now.gg, saved under
// public/creator-brand/nowgg-signin/ (shared public assets — the paths work from this route too).
// The previous version of this file was a likeness built from a screenshot and it was wrong in ways
// a screenshot cannot show: the typeface is POPPINS (not this site's Inter/Space Grotesk), the card
// is a dark panel with a 0.8px #7B4CFF ring — not the warm brown it looked like — and the header is
// TWO translucent gradient wave SVGs layered over that glass rather than a solid gradient strip.
//
// The measured spec, so nobody has to re-scrape to check a value:
//   card        360px wide · radius 12 · 0.8px solid #7B4CFF · overflow hidden. Ours is a SOLID
//               dark grey with NO backdrop blur (scraped: translucent black + blur) — see CARD_BG.
//   waves       360x135 @ opacity .4 and 360x123 @ opacity .5, both #7B4CFF -> #0EA4C5, second
//               reversed · header block 110px tall, 16px below it
//   "One account for"   Poppins 12/18 · 400 · #fff · padding 16 0 8
//   logos row   gap 18 · BlueStacks mark 42x38 + wordmark 75x13 at gap 10.84 · a 1x35 vertical
//               gradient rule (transparent -> rgba(255,255,255,.4) -> transparent) · now.gg 122x37
//   heading     Poppins 20/30 · 600 · #fff
//   sub-heading Poppins 14/21 · 400 · rgba(255,255,255,.7) at opacity .9 · 8 above
//   field label 10 · 600 · +1.5px tracking · uppercase · rgba(255,255,255,.8) · 4 above its input
//   input       14/21 · 400 · #fff · bg rgba(0,0,0,.2) · radius 8 · 0.8px rgba(255,255,255,.5) ·
//               shadow 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,.04) · padding 8 16
//   Continue    14/21 · 600 · linear-gradient(270deg,#7B4CFF 0%,#0EA4C5 99.48%) · radius 8 ·
//               padding 6 24 · 41px tall
//   separator   row gap 16 · rule + "Or sign in with" at 14/14 · 400 · rgba(255,255,255,.4)
//   providers   row gap 16 · each 68x40 · radius 8 · padding 10 24 · Apple/Google rgba(255,255,255,.9),
//               Discord #8061FF, Facebook #2178FA
//   legal       12/18 · 400 · #fff · links underlined, same colour
//   form gaps   16 between blocks, 4 between a label and its input, 24 horizontal padding
//
// STILL NOT A REAL LOGIN, and it must never become one. There is no auth behind this: the email
// field collects nothing, has no name/autoComplete, and posts nowhere. Every control lands on the
// same prototype sign-in so a reviewer can't dead-end on a button that looks operable.
// SOLID DARK GREY, NO BLUR (designer, 2026-08-13). The scrape's card is glass, but the blur was
// never visible — the site scrim sits between this card and the page, and a backdrop-filter can
// only reveal what is behind it. Solid rather than any alpha: a translucent card's read changes
// with whatever page is behind it, and a solid one is the same card every time.
