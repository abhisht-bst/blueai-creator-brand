import ApplyForm from './apply/ApplyForm'

// The top of the page once a NEW creator is signed in — a headline and the application, in place of
// the marketing hero. Ported from creator-brand/creators/ApplySection.tsx; copy verbatim, skin =
// this page's own hero vocabulary (kit h1 + .grad gradient line + .sub — the same classes the
// marketing hero uses, so signing in doesn't drop the reader onto a page that speaks differently).
//
// IT REPLACES THE HERO RATHER THAN SITTING UNDER IT (source's architecture, kept): signing in means
// the pitch has landed — leaving the headline/artwork above the form pushes the thing you just
// signed in to do below the fold. Everything after this section stays, because it still answers real
// questions someone half-way through an application will have.
//
// NO PixelRain — this page's ambiance is its own stars/sky; importing the light hero's twinkle layer
// would be a second ambient system fighting the first.
//
// `#apply` is the scroll target for the page's Apply CTAs once signed in. DELIBERATELY NO entrance
// animation on the form (source's rule, kept): this section can mount while the viewport is anywhere
// on the page, and a missed reveal here is an invisible application form, not a late fade — and the
// thing the reader signed in to do doesn't want noise in front of it.

            said the name, the click said apply, this h1 closes the loop. PLAIN, NO GRADIENT, on
            purpose (same review): the site's grad goes on chosen words on pitch screens; this is
            a working screen (the dashboard's plain h1 is the precedent) and the title is
            ops-authored data — a display treatment on arbitrary data eventually produces a
