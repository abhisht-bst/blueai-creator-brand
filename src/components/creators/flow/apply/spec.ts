// Ported verbatim from creator-brand/creators/apply/spec.ts — PURE DATA, no styling, so the port is
// byte-faithful apart from the forms import path. Every question, option gate and message is the
// PM's; see the source file for the full grouping history.
//
// THE QUESTIONS ARE THE PM'S, VERBATIM IN INTENT. What is NOT the PM's is the GROUPING — the brief
// said "minimal and with proper segregation so it doesn't overwhelm the creator", which is a
// constraint, not a layout. Eleven fields in one column is the thing that brief exists to prevent, so
// they're split into four steps of two to four, each answering one question a reader can hold in
// their head: are you eligible, what's your channel, can you deliver, how do we pay and reach you.
//
// CUT TO FOUR STEPS, NOT FIVE (PM, 2026-08-13). The PC-specs step (OS + RAM) is gone entirely —
// dropped as a question, not just reshuffled, so os/ram no longer exist on Draft at all. The two
// separate consent checkboxes ("okay to be contacted for feedback", "okay to be emailed about the
// program") are also gone, replaced by ONE checkbox at the very end that covers both plus the
// Program Terms — see `agree` below.
//
// "WHY DO YOU WANT TO JOIN?" CUT (PM, 2026-08-14), replaced by two capacity chip questions (pcHours,
// runDays) — see StepThree for the reasoning and options.tsx for why the answers are fixed ranges.
