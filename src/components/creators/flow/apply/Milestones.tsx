// The application's journey strip — Apply → We review → Deploy & earn — rendered above the form
// card, and above the confirmation panel once submitted, with "We review" lit. Ported from
// creator-brand/creators/apply/Milestones.tsx (stage prop API unchanged); skin = the kit's .crx-mile
// family. It exists because the form alone didn't tell a new applicant what the process is (PM
// feedback, 2026-08-14): the review stage and the invite email were only discoverable below the
// fold, and an applicant on step 1 had no picture of what happens after Submit.
//
// THREE steps, not four. An "Invite email" step between review and install was drafted and cut
// (PM, 2026-08-14): the email is how "We review" ends, not a stage the applicant does anything in.
// And NO accepted/final state here at all — an accepted creator signing in is routed to the
// dashboard, never back to this page, so a lit third dot is a state this strip can never truthfully
// show.
//
// Visual language is borrowed, not invented (kit rules): done dots fill with --grad-bright like the
// form's own Rail segments, the current ring is the iris selection treatment the choices already
// use, and pending sits on the page's inert hairline.
// "Deploy & earn", not "Install & earn" (the PM's copy, canonical): the landing's step 03 is
// "Deploy it", so the strip and the page use one verb for the same moment.
