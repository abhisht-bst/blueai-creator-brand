// Root Screen Library — the handoff index (like WSUP's). Links to every blueAI page via
// full-page <a> (each route loads its own scoped CSS, so this avoids cross-route accumulation).
//
// REORGANISED 2026-08-01 around the scope pivot: this page used to list nine cards flat, with the
// ACTIVE surface (blueai-desktop) buried sixth and described as a "JS experiment", and the pinned
// design-system card pointing at the DORMANT marketing style guide. An index that misstates which
// work is current misleads every reviewer who lands here — grouping by status IS the information.
//
// REORGANISED AGAIN 2026-09-14 (Abhisht): the acquisition surfaces now group by AUDIENCE — creator
// page experiments and brand page experiments — because that is how they are reviewed. Nothing is
// deleted while its deployed page is still used for comparison: earlier creator/partner pages stay
// listed, including the frozen creator side of the creator-brand shell, which returns to the index
// after being dropped from it on 2026-08-19.

/* COMPACT ROWS (Appy, 2026-09-09). Titles only. With descriptions each row ran about 90px, so
   roughly six fitted in a viewport and every group below Active needed scrolling to find. A row
   is now a single line at about 40px, so the whole library reads at a glance, which is the job
   of an index page.

   The desc strings are deliberately NOT deleted. They move to the title attribute and surface on
   hover, because they carry real handoff context (why a surface exists, what superseded what,
   which of two versions is current) and trading permanent information for vertical space is a bad
   swap. Keeping them addressable also stops them going dead in the arrays above.

   The design-system row also drops its "Design system" eyebrow: it forced a second line, and the
   name it sat above already ends in "Design System". */
