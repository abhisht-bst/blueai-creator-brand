    'An AI job application agent applies to jobs the way a person would: it opens a job app, reads a listing, decides if it fits your criteria, fills in the form, answers the screening questions, and submits. BlueAI is a real agent that runs inside an Android session, so it operates the actual Indeed, LinkedIn and company career apps on screen rather than scraping a website or calling an API that can break.',

    { h: 'Is it safe for my accounts?', p: 'When you run it yourself, BlueAI acts inside your own logged-in session and never hands your data to a third party. You stay in control: approve each submit, set a daily cap, and stop the run any time. It applies only to roles that match your criteria, so it does not mass-spam, which protects your standing with recruiters.' },
    { h: 'Will it tailor my resume and answers to each job?', p: 'Yes. The AI job application worker reads each job description and adjusts your professional summary, the skills it highlights, and the answers to free-text screening questions so they match what the listing asks for. It works from the resume and profile you provide, so the facts stay yours and only the emphasis changes per role. You can review every tailored application before it is sent.' },

BlueAI is a general agent: it sees the screen, plans its next step, and recovers from errors, so it handles the messy multi-step external applications that one-click bots cannot, across Indeed, LinkedIn and company career portals rather than just one.' },
    { h: 'How many jobs can it apply to in a day?', p: 'You set the cap. Many people run 20 to 40 tailored applications a day, far more than is realistic by hand but well below the volume that gets accounts flagged.
