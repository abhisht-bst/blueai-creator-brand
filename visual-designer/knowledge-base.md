# blueAI — Knowledge Base
Last updated: 2026-08-11 (Session 18 — +1 trap (a throw inside requestAnimationFrame/any async callback
surfaces nowhere in the UI: the sequence stops mid-way and reads as FINISHED, console only — so read the
console before re-reading your own logic) and widened the `d || DEFAULT` "cannot express its own absence"
trap to cover DECLARATION ORDER, which produced the same plausible-wrong-state from `var` hoisting. Earlier:
2026-08-11 (Session 17 — 3 new blueai-desktop traps: the `#scaler` scaled-vs-local px divide (2 instances, one of which produced 54 false failures in a brand-new gate), the `x || default` falsy-argument footgun, and the vacuous-harness-pass class. Earlier: 2026-08-01 (the design-system build — DS architecture + traps: base-href fragment rebasing, token scope vs fixed-position, the .bai-scope alias, pill-radius clamping, ellipsis false positives, pinned generators))

## blueai-desktop — CSS + testing traps (2026-07-25 audit, first entries for this surface)
- **A flex container's `gap` ADDS to a child's own pre-existing CSS margin — it does not collapse or
  override it.** Moving a component (e.g. a `.bai-set-label`, designed assuming it's the ONLY spacing
  mechanism around it) into a NEW container that has its own `gap` silently doubles the space on
  whichever side the margin still has a value. Caught on the AI Credits screen's "CREDIT BREAKDOWN"
  label: `margin: 0 0 8px` inside a `gap:10` wrap rendered as 10px above (gap alone, margin-top was
  zeroed) but 18px below (gap 10 + margin-bottom 8) — backwards from "label owns what's right below
  it." Fix: net the margin against the gap (`margin-bottom: -2px` → effective 8px), don't assume old
  standalone-context spacing math still holds once nested in a gap-controlled parent. **Always
  measure with `getBoundingClientRect`, not eyeballed** — this exact inversion is invisible by eye at
  a 2px-ish difference and only surfaced once actually measured.
- **A "hover menu closes before I can reach it" bug can ONLY be verified with real, stepped mouse
  travel — a before/after snapshot check will report success while the bug still ships.** The failure
  happens DURING the cursor's transit across the gap between the trigger and a `position:absolute`
  floating menu (`mouseleave` fires on the trigger the instant the cursor crosses ANY non-descendant
  element in that gap, even a menu that IS a real DOM child). Root fix: wire show/hide to BOTH the
  trigger and the floating menu (either one being hovered keeps it open) + a short grace-period
  timeout (150ms) so brief crossing jitter never triggers a hide. Verification: Playwright
  `mouse.move(x, y, {steps: N})` stepping from the trigger to the target, polling the shown/hidden
  state at every intermediate step — not `page.hover()` (which jumps) and not a scripted `.click()`
  (which bypasses the real hover mechanism entirely). Caught on the credits-header popover after
  designer report: "when I go over to view details it closes before I reach it."

## Design-system architecture + traps (2026-08-01 — the DS build)
- **A <base href> re-bases FRAGMENT links too.** Copying index.html's `<base href="/blueai-desktop/">` into
  style-guide.html made every `#section` link resolve to `/blueai-desktop/#section`, which the server answers
  with the directory index — so every sidebar click left the guide for the product. Inheriting a solution
  without inheriting its problem. A page whose own paths are same-directory relative needs no base at all.
- **Tokens scoped to `.drawer` do not reach `position:fixed` descendants of `<body>` — but the fix is to
  hand them the scope, not to give up.** (Rewritten 2026-08-01; the first version of this entry taught the
  wrong move.) Tokenising the dev Preview panel's sizes once collapsed its radius to 0px because it lives
  outside `.drawer`; the original entry concluded "literals + a do-not-tokenise note, NOT widening the token
  scope." That conclusion outlived its own justification the day `.bai-scope` (the tokens-only alias) was
  created, and the raw literals then sat in the guide's tally as unexplained amber rows until the designer
  asked why. Current truth: the panel's wrapper carries `bai-scope`, its sizes go through tokens, and zero
  per-selector exemptions remain in the gate. The durable lessons: *check ancestry before tokenising anything
  fixed-position* (still true), and *an exemption is a claim with an expiry date that nothing re-checks —
  re-derive it whenever the mechanism it cites changes.*
- **A tokens-only alias makes a style guide possible.** Component rules here are plain global classes that
  resolve `var(--bai-*)`; only the token declarations are `.drawer`-scoped. Adding `.bai-scope` alongside
  `.drawer` on the token blocks (and on the three `.drawer.light` component overrides) lets any container
  request the real token values with no second copy. Do not alias it onto the `.drawer` LAYOUT rule.
- **A 20px radius on a <=40px-tall element is already fully round**, so 20px -> 999px is a no-op: radius is
  clamped to half the smaller dimension. Proven by pixel-diffing `.bai-tgl` at both values (byte-identical),
  not assumed.
- **`overflow:hidden` + `text-overflow:ellipsis` + `nowrap` always reports `scrollWidth > clientWidth`.** An
  overflow scanner must exclude it or it reports every designed truncation as a defect.
- **A generator that reads HEAD becomes un-re-runnable once its own output is adopted.** `gen_icons.js` read
  the product's literal icon paths from `git show HEAD`; after index.html was rewired to read them back from
  the generated file, HEAD no longer contained them. Pin such scripts to the source commit.

## Creator-v2 studio-concept era (S8 audit — the 06-13→06-24 backlog)
- **AnimatePresence orphan trap:** toggling presence DURING the exit animation orphans the scrim DOM node — a dead full-screen scrim that no state change can remove (we had 2 stacked). For modals that can be opened/closed fast → **conditional render** (`if (!open) return null`) + a plain enter-only `motion.div`; reserve AnimatePresence for surfaces that can't be rapid-toggled.
- **Popover escape kit (three distinct traps, one component):** (1) `backdrop-filter` creates a stacking context — a menu inside it can't out-z LATER siblings; lift the CONTEXT (`position:relative; z-index` on the flex item — flex-item z-index applies). (2) An ancestor `overflow:hidden` clips absolute menus regardless of z-index → **createPortal to `document.body`** with `position:fixed` from `getBoundingClientRect` (+ close on outside-mousedown excluding trigger AND menu, Escape, scroll, resize). (3) Portaled CSS must be UNSCOPED (it renders outside the page root class) — safe when tokens live at `:root`. This is `CreatorSelect.tsx` — reuse it for any themed dropdown.
- **WebGL canvas (GradientCanvas):** size from a **ResizeObserver**, not window `resize` (preview_resize doesn't dispatch it); dispose renderer/geometry on unmount; `prefers-reduced-motion` → render one static frame.
- **Two dev servers on one Next project corrupt the shared `.next` cache** (PackFileCacheStrategy ENOENT rename → phantom 404s + 90s+ latencies). PERMANENT FIX in place: `distDir: process.env.BLUEAI_DIST_DIR || '.next'` + the blueai-3001 launch config sets `.next-3001`. If it still recurs: stop server → clear `.next/cache` → restart.
- **Verification traps on animated pages:** `preview_screenshot` wedges on WebGL/continuous-motion pages (renderer never idles) → verify via DOM/computed-style evals, SSR-HTML greps, direct HTTP probes. React re-render is ASYNC → click in one eval, READ in a separate eval. Clicks immediately after reload no-op (hydration race). `target=_blank` navs throw in headless evals (artifact, not a bug).
- **Licensed stock for a public deploy:** Pexels API (free, commercial OK, no attribution) is the source for demo media; NEVER scrape branded AI-tool outputs (IP exposure — declined twice, designer agreed). Media auto-replace convention: drop real files at `public/videos/<slug>.mp4/.jpg` → replaces everywhere by filename, zero code change.
- **Typewriter-as-placeholder:** animate example prompts in a GHOST layer shown only while `value === '' && !focused`; the field itself stays editable — a readOnly lock on the MAIN input reads as broken (taste 35).

## Motion, stacking, and clone mechanics (S6 — live-demo-v2)
- **framer-motion does NOT reliably interpolate `clip-path` strings — it SNAPS to the target.** For a clip-path wipe/reveal, use a CSS `@keyframes` + a class toggle; keep framer for `pathLength`, opacity, transform. (Confirmed: animating `clipPath: inset(0%)→inset(100%)` via framer jumped instantly.)
- **A double object-spread clobbers the framer `animate` prop.** `<motion.x {...drawA} {...drawB} />` where both define `animate`/`transition` → the second wins, the first's keyframes silently vanish. Merge into ONE `animate`. (This — not `var()` — was the blank-blueprint bug. **`var()` in SVG presentation attributes `stroke=`/`fill=` DOES work in Chrome**; the earlier "doesn't resolve" note is retracted. Still prefer CSS for SVG color so framer owns only motion.)
- **A fixed/floating child can NEVER escape an ancestor's stacking context.** A `z-index` on any ancestor (e.g. `main { z-index:1 }`) caps a `position:fixed` descendant at that ancestor's level — so a later sibling (the footer) paints over it. Fix: give ancestors NO z-index (DOM order alone layers content above a z-0 backdrop); raise only the few elements that must win (nav). Audit every ancestor `z-index` whenever fixed/docked UI exists.
- **Miniaturize a live view by SCALING the designed layout (`transform: scale`), never by reflowing it** to a width it wasn't built for (reflow at miniature = cropped/cramped). Keep the designed canvas size, scale the whole thing.
- **`/route` REDIRECT (not rewrite) when a static page uses RELATIVE asset paths** (an iframe `src="app.html"`): a rewrite keeps the URL at `/route` so the relative path 404s; a redirect lands the browser on `/route/index.html` where it resolves. Static clone = byte-copy into `public/` (hash-verify), strip any nested `.git` (an embedded repo breaks `git add`).
- **The dev server can die SILENTLY** (browser shows an error page, the log just stops — no crash trace). Before debugging a "broken" route, CHECK THE PORT (`Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000`); restart if down. Happened ~5× in S6 — a process-stability quirk, not the code.
- **Verifying a transient (~1-2s) animation through high-latency tooling:** screenshots race the animation and usually land after it finishes. To SEE a phase: temporarily HOLD the component there (drop the advance-timeouts / lengthen the duration), screenshot, revert. For endpoints, a settle check + a mid-animation DOM sample (computed style) is enough.

## Style-guide architecture + verification traps (S5)
- **`form-kit.tsx` molecules** (`components/agent/form-kit.tsx`) — the layer between the `.jmf-*` atoms (agent.css) and the 4 form components: `Field` (generic label+control+hint, `<div>` because controls may contain buttons) · `TextField`/`TextAreaField`/`SelectField` (label-wrapped natives) · `PillsField` (single OR multi — `value: string | string[]`) · `Tabs<K>` (generic key type) · `FormHead` · `Agree` · `Submit` (always carries `<Arrow size={18}/>`). No form hand-writes field markup. Documented standalone in SG "Form field molecules".
- **SG anatomy primitives** (`components/style-guide/Anatomy.tsx`): `Anatomy` (per-row recipe table) · `Tok` (mono token name linking to a `tok-*` id) · `PreviewAnatomy` (`layout='split'` for narrow components, `'stack'` for full-width ones like the header — a half-width column would distort a full-bleed preview). Token focus ring: `[id^='tok-']:target` in `style-guide.css` draws an iris ring + brief pulse on the linked swatch (reduced-motion gated).
- **NEVER wrap a contained SG showcase in a PAGE-ROOT scope class without the reset.** `.v-site`/`.v-seo`/`.bai-home`/`.v-rewards` carry `min-height:100vh` + a page background — a demo wrapped in one balloons to a full viewport. `.sg-demo` (style-guide.css) neutralises both while keeping the scoped descendant CSS working.
- **A hash-only navigation (`/page#x`) is a same-document scroll, NOT a reload — the browser keeps serving the originally-loaded CSS/JS.** Cost ~10 cycles: every rebuild looked like it "did nothing" (the `text-2xs` rule "missing" after a config add, an @layer add, a plain-CSS add — ALL actually worked). Before re-measuring a CSS/token change in the browser, force `location.reload()` or navigate to a genuinely different path. Corollary: never ship a comment asserting a mechanism "doesn't work" until verified under a true reload (the Tailwind `2xs` fontSize key works fine).
- **Reading DOM state synchronously after `.click()` races React's re-render** — `className` checks right after a click read the PRE-update DOM and falsely report "no toggle." Await ~100ms (or a `requestAnimationFrame`) before asserting.
- **Anatomy/doc rows must be grep-verified against the real CSS** — I wrote `.jmf-label` from memory; the class is `.jmf-lbl`. Recipes are quotes, not recollections.
- **Neutral + page channel tokens (S5):** `--bai-ink-rgb: 8,10,31` (every neutral scrim/hairline/shadow rgba derives from it) · `--bai-shadow-hairline` (+ `shadow-hairline` utility — resting cards) · `--bai-page-rgb`/`--bai-page`/`--bai-page-grad` (the marketing page surface + gradient; frosted bars = `rgba(var(--bai-page-rgb), .8)`). Tailwind `float`/`overlay` point at the `--shadow-*` vars (SSOT). Known boundary (unchanged): SVG `<stop>` attrs can't take `var()` — FinanceLegacy's two gradient stops stay literal.

## Agent demo form kit (`.jmf-*`) + interactive demo primitives (S4 — the discrepancy sweep)
The 4 agent pages' hero demos are FAITHFUL INTERACTIVE replicas of the live bluestacks.ai forms (design-only — submits `preventDefault`), built on one shared CSS kit + a few client components:
- **`.jmf-*` kit** (in `agent.css`): `jmf-card` (panel) · `jmf-head`/`jmf-title`/`jmf-sub` · `jmf-field`/`jmf-lbl`/`jmf-opt` · `jmf-input`(+`jmf-textarea`,`jmf-select` w/ data-URI chevron) · `jmf-tabs`/`jmf-tab` (segmented toggle) · `jmf-pills`/`jmf-pill.is-on`/`jmf-check` (single- OR multi-select) · `jmf-upload`/`jmf-file-*` · `jmf-agree` (checkbox) · `jmf-hint` · `jmf-submit` (full-width CTA + `<Arrow>`). Accent = solid `--bai-mkt-blue` (matches the live's solid blue, NOT the brand gradient); focus ring `rgba(var(--bai-mkt-blue-rgb),.15)`.
- **`components/agent/`**: `CareerForm` (8 fields incl. multi-select Location + Seniority `<select>` + Resume upload + agree), `CreatorForm` (textarea + Style/Platforms/Length pills), `FinanceForm` + `MarketsForm` (TABBED — Upload/Ask, Watch/Ask), `FileUpload` (stateful — see below), `VideoCard` (click-to-play), `glyphs.tsx` (`Check`/`UploadIcon`).
- **`FileUpload`** — the all-states control (taste rule 24): hidden native `<input type=file>` triggered by a custom "Choose file" button; EMPTY = upload icon + Choose file + "No file chosen"; FILLED = file icon + filename + remove (✕), box flips dashed→solid (`is-filled`); ✕ resets state + `input.value=''`. **Wrap it in a `<div>`, NOT a `<label>`** — a label would double-fire the picker alongside the trigger button.
- **`VideoCard`** — real `<video>` (poster + `loop`/`playsInline`/`preload=metadata`, no native controls), click toggles play/pause, overlay hides while playing; guard `el.play()?.catch(()=>{})` (autoplay-interruption rejects). Videos live in `public/videos/` (downloaded from the live site).
- **Tabs are styled toggle buttons** (`aria-pressed`), NOT a full ARIA tablist — a `role="tab"` without `role="tabpanel"`+`aria-controls` is a worse, incomplete contract; for a segmented control that swaps inline fields, `aria-pressed` is the honest semantic.
- **Documented in `/style-guide` → "Agent page components"** (S4 audit — `components/style-guide/AgentComponents.tsx`): live `CareerForm` (the kit) + tabbed `FinanceForm` + `FileUpload` (all states) + trade-log BUY/SELL badges + `VideoCard`, rendered REAL (wrapped in `.v-agent`) so the docs can't drift. **Tokenisation verdict (S4, mechanically grepped):** every color/radius/shadow uses `--bai-*` / `--radius-*` / channel-rgb tokens; the BUY/SELL badges reuse `--bai-success/danger-*`. The ONLY raw colors are **Tier-3 bespoke** (the VideoCard frame gradient `#2a2350…` + play glyph `#1b1340` — single-surface decoration, stays local per the tiering rule) + the **deferred neutral-ink alpha** `rgba(8,10,31,…)` (the file's established shadow/tint literal). No Tier-1/2 leaks; no new global token was needed. Literal px for type/spacing in scoped marketing CSS is the DORMANT MARKETING SITE's frozen convention (matches homepage/hero CSS) — **SCOPE CLAUSE added 2026-08-03, because as written this sentence contradicted two standing rules and an audit caught it.** Craft rule 40 (*"tokenise sizes, not just colours — an untokenised axis drifts by default"*) is explicitly declared surface-independent, and rule 26 is a designer directive with no scope clause at all (*"EVERYTHING is tokenised — even a space or padding"*). Both outrank this note. It is a record of what the dormant site already IS, frozen, **not a precedent and never a defence for new work** — blueai-desktop has zero raw font-size/radius px and `ds-drift-check.js` §8 fails on any. If the marketing site ever resumes, tokenising it is the correct first move, not an exception to be preserved.

## CSS + shared-template gotchas (S4)
- **Descendant element selectors are specificity traps.** `.ag-more-card span` (0,2,1) OUT-SPECIFIES a `.ag-more-ic` class (0,2,0) — and an icon wrapper IS a span — so the text-styling rule (`display:block; 12px`) bled onto the emoji tile and cramped it top-left. **Scope text rules to the inner wrapper class** (`.ag-more-tx span`), never `.card span`. Any `.parent element` selector silently captures every matching descendant.
- **Shared-template copy must be data-driven, never hardcoded.** `AgentShell` hardcoded the how-it-works H2 as "From targets to done" (career's words) → it leaked onto creator/finance/markets. Fix: per-instance `hiwHeading` field on `AgentData` with a default. Any shared shell rendering instance-specific copy must read it from data.
- **When the in-page (Claude-in-Chrome) extension blocks a DOM read** with `[BLOCKED: Cookie/query string data]` (triggered by URL-bearing content — e.g. Polymarket/Kalshi links in the markets SEO copy), fall back to `node -e "fetch(url).then(r=>r.text())"` on the SSR HTML + strip tags. The SSR markup carries the same text.
- **A mobile dropdown menu must be OPAQUE + dim the page behind it (scrim)** — never translucent over live content (the hero text ghosts through; a 2nd CTA below competes). Opaque menu + a tap-to-close scrim (`top:100%` so the bar stays crisp) is the focused-overlay pattern.

> blueAI's reusable components, patterns, and token hygiene. blueAI's own — unrelated
> to WSUP/now.gg.

## Component library (BUILT — session 1)
**Foundation**
- `globals.css` — the `--bai-*` token layer (brand gradient + wash, cool neutral ramp,
  type/spacing/radii/shadow/motion vars) + the `.bai-*` semantic type classes (DS API).
- `tailwind.config.ts` — utilities mapped onto the vars (`bg-iris`, `text-ink-*`,
  `bg-bai-gradient`/`bg-bai-wash`, `rounded-card/field/pill/bubble-*`, `shadow-float/overlay`,
  `font-head`/`font-brand`, the px type scale).

**Homepage (`components/home/`)** — shared body under every hero, styles in `styles/homepage.css` (`.bai-home`).
- `BaiHome` — orchestrator (intro → features → skills → all-skills → powered-by → footer).
- `FeatureRows` — 5 alternating feature rows (data: `lib/home-data.ts` FEATURES).
- `AllSkills` — 15-card skill grid + "more on the way" tile (data: SKILLS).
- `DownloadCta` — the tri-stop gradient "Download BlueAI" pill (also the hero CTA via `HeroCta`).

**Hero (`components/hero/`)**
- `HeroStage` (rich, 2-col, Recommended) · `HeroCards` (legacy, 3-card) · `HeroStageOriginal` (legacy, big stage + rail).
- `HeroNav` (shared nav + logomark) · `HeroCta` · `HeroArrow`.
- Scenes — RICH: `scenes/{Career,Creator,Finance}Scene.tsx`. LEGACY (shared by 3-Cards + Stage Original): `scenes/{Career,Creator,Finance}Legacy.tsx`.
- Hooks: `useTypewriter` (typed text) · `useCountUp` (eased number count).

**Style guide (`components/style-guide/` + `app/style-guide/`)**
- `ComponentsSection` (buttons · ✦ pills · feature cards · message bubbles · composer · panel header) + the page (Colors · Type · Scales · Components).

## Patterns
- **Phase-driven Framer scene** (codified S1): a `STEPS` array of setTimeouts advances a
  `phase` int on mount; `motion` components animate off `phase` (no GSAP). Scene replays
  by remounting (AnimatePresence key / conditional render on activation). Reusable for any
  multi-step demo animation.
- **Per-route scoped hero CSS + full-nav `<a>`** (codified S1): variants that reuse generic
  class names at different sizes stay isolated by route; cross-route links must be full-page.
- **Gradient text** — `.text-gradient` utility (background-clip:text on `--bai-gradient`)
  for inline "BlueAI" / "BlueStacks AI" highlights + the credits count.
- **Spotlight animation loop** (S2) — multi-instance demo scenes (the 3-card grid, the
  rail-of-agents) animate ONE at a time. Each scene takes an `active` prop and only runs its
  phase timeline when active; inactive scenes rest at the FINAL/completed phase
  (`useState(active ? 0 : FINAL)`; `useCountUp` got an `instant` flag so resting counters show
  the end value). The active scene replays from scratch via a KEYED REMOUNT (bump a `gen`/`key`
  on activation). Hover pauses the loop + restarts the hovered scene; leave resumes. Never let
  all scenes auto-play on mount.

## Motion (framer-motion) — load-bearing gotchas (S2)
A whole family of bugs traces to **framer owning two things React doesn't expect**:
- **It owns the `transform` property.** Centering a `motion.*` element with CSS
  `transform: translate(-50%,-50%)` FAILS — framer overwrites transform with its animated value
  (e.g. `scale`), leaving the element offset. Center with `position:absolute; inset:0;
  margin:auto` (definite size) or flex/grid on the parent. (Hit on `.cv-play`.)
- **It replays `initial → animate` on EVERY mount.** A keyed component that remounts in a
  "should-not-animate" state still plays its entrance. Pass `initial={false}` to mount straight
  at the resting state. (Hit when the spotlight handed off — just-left cards re-animated.)
- **Type the `initial`/`animate` helpers as `TargetAndTransition`, not `object`.** `object` is
  too wide for framer's prop union and FAILS the prod `next build` typecheck (passes in dev).
  (S2 deploy fix — the `init(v?: object)` helper in the 3 legacy scenes.)
- **Animated footers over flowing content** — don't absolutely-pin them (they overlap when
  content grows); let them flow with `margin-top:auto` in a flex column. MEASURE gaps in-browser
  (`getBoundingClientRect`), don't eyeball — a by-eye estimate was 3× off.

## CSS architecture — production chunking can leak generic class rules (S2, important)
The per-route-scoped hero stylesheets reuse generic global class names (`.hero`, `.pane-title`,
`.hero-screen`). The "isolated by route + full-page `<a>` nav" mitigation holds in DEV (CSS
injected in import order) but NOT in the production bundle: Next chunked **hero-cards.css's
`.hero{text-align:center}` onto the `/hero/stage` route**, so the Stage `.hero` (no text-align)
resolved to center and `.hero-right` inherited it → heading/scene centered on Vercel, left in dev.
Confirmed by fetching the live CSS chunks.
- **Cheap guard (used):** never rely on INHERITANCE for a property a sibling stylesheet sets on
  a shared class — set it explicitly on a uniquely-named descendant. An own declaration beats an
  inherited value regardless of chunk grouping/order (`.hero-right{text-align:left}`;
  `.hero-right` is Stage-only).
- **Proper fix (DONE, S2):** scoped each variant stylesheet under a unique root class —
  `.v-stage` / `.v-cards` / `.v-original` (added to each page wrapper), mirroring `.bai-home` /
  `.ho`. `.hero-page`/`.hero-screen` are shared by all 3 variants, so a NEW per-variant modifier
  class was added. Done via `.scripts/scope-css.js` (idempotent postcss transform — `:root` +
  `@keyframes` kept global). Verified: the built bundle has ZERO unscoped generic hero rules →
  cross-route leaks are now structurally impossible (also closes the `.hero` padding leak + the
  Stage-Original `.cv-trend` bug). The `.hero-right{text-align:left}` guard is now redundant-but-
  harmless. **If a 4th variant / new shared-name stylesheet is added, scope it from the start.**
- **`next build` runs STRICT TS; `next dev` does not.** Always `npx next build` before relying on
  a deploy — two prod build failures in S2 (the framer type + the CSS leak, the latter only
  visible in the prod bundle).
- **CSS-comment `*/` gotcha (S2 audit #2):** a `*/` sequence ANYWHERE inside a `/* … */` comment closes
  it early → postcss "Unclosed block (n:n)" build fail pointing at the next `{`. Bit me writing the
  literal `--seo-*/--green` in a token comment (the `*/` killed the comment, the rest became bad CSS).
  Never put `*/` — or a glob like `--x-*/…` — in CSS comment prose. `next dev` may not surface it; `next build` does.
- **NEVER run `npx next build` while `next dev` is running (S2 audit #2 — cost a confusing debug).** The
  prod build overwrites the dev server's `.next`, so dev then serves SSR HTML that references dev JS chunks
  which now 404 (`main-app.js`, `app-pages-internals.js`) → the page renders but **never hydrates**: looks
  perfect in screenshots, but no interactivity (a hamburger that won't open, dead framer animations). Tell-tale:
  404s on `/_next/static/chunks/*` in the dev log. Fix: kill dev → `rm -rf .next` → restart `npm run dev`.
  For a prod-build check while iterating, STOP dev first; for small changes, trust dev's compile + screenshots.

## Token / layout hygiene (S2)
- **Tailwind silently drops UNDEFINED utilities** (no error). `rounded-circle` was used 9× but
  `circle` wasn't in the config → all 9 rendered as squares. Verify a `rounded-*`/token key
  exists in `tailwind.config.ts`; a fabricated semantic name fails silently and visibly.
- **One shared content-width token across every full-width band** (`--bai-content: 1180px`, 40px
  gutter) so content edges align vertically down the page — inconsistent max-widths read as
  accidental. GOTCHA: a flex item with `margin:auto` won't stretch to its max-width (auto-margins
  disable flex stretch) — add `width:100%`.
- **`order`-swapped rows with asymmetric grid tracks size by POSITION, not element** — to keep
  one element (a feature image) consistently larger across alternating left/right rows, MIRROR
  `grid-template-columns` per direction (`.feat` vs `.feat.reverse`); verify by measuring EVERY
  instance, not just row 1.
- **Equal grid columns: use `minmax(0, 1fr)`, not `1fr`** (S2-cont). `1fr` = `minmax(auto,1fr)`, so
  an item with wide min-content (an SVG chart, nowrap text) balloons its track and squeezes the rest
  — the Finance card came out wider than its siblings. `minmax(0,1fr)` + `min-width:0` on the item =
  truly equal columns. *(Gate-8 miss — designer caught it on review.)*
- **Per-route width override via a scoped token** (S2-cont). To widen/narrow ONE route without
  touching the shared nav stylesheet or other routes, override the content-width custom property on
  that route's scope (`.v-cards .hero-screen { --bai-content: N }`) — the shared nav + hero inherit it.
- **Content-width model (refined S2-cont):** a wide/full-bleed NAV over a CONTAINED ~1280 content
  column (hero + sections + footer share one `--seo-content` token). Aligning ALL bands to the wide
  header read too wide (bad line length, sparse grids). Full-bleed nav + contained content is the
  standard pattern, NOT misalignment. → taste rule 20.

## Mobile (S2)
- **App-style split-pane** (fixed sidebar + independently-scrolling main, `h-screen
  overflow-hidden`) MUST be gated to a desktop breakpoint; on mobile collapse to single-column
  normal-scroll and hide/relocate the sidebar.
- **A fixed-height box holding responsive text overlaps its absolute children when the text grows
  on small screens** — bump the height (or drop content) at the breakpoint.
- **N-up rows of labeled items need a mobile plan** (stack icon-over-label, or drop secondary
  affordances like arrows).
- **Click-to-scroll + scroll-spy fight** — add a short (~700ms) lock after a click so the spy
  doesn't re-highlight mid-scroll; a sticky nav needs a matching scroll OFFSET (scrollIntoView
  can't offset).
- **Always screenshot mobile yourself** — can't eyeball it from the desktop live view.
- **A content page's section-anchor nav needs a real mobile MENU** (S2-cont) — a hamburger → the
  section links + CTA, never just `display:none` on the links (that strands the navigation). The
  menu OVERLAYS content (`position:absolute` below the sticky bar with a shadow), it does NOT push
  content down. CTAs go full-width on mobile for tap targets.

## Components (S2)
- **HeroNav = single source of truth** for the marketing/hero nav: one `<HeroNav/>` + one
  `hero-nav.css` (imported by the component so styles travel with it); per-variant diffs exposed
  as a token (`--nav-pad-y`). Showcased as a LIVE "Marketing nav" section in `/style-guide` (renders
  the real component → can't drift). A component duplicated across variants is a DS smell → extract.

## SEO homepage + brand primitives (S2-cont)
- **`/seo` page** (`app/seo/page.tsx` + `components/seo/*` + `lib/seo-data.ts` + `styles/seo-home.css`,
  ALL scoped `.v-seo`): a standalone content-rich, search-optimized homepage. Sections: nav · hero
  (2×2 animated agents) · What-is (featured-snippet def) · chatbot/assistant/worker frame · 8-card
  task hub (internal links) · 4 steps · FAQ accordion · CTA · footer. Reuses the legacy agent scenes
  (their CSS DUPLICATED under `.v-seo` — scene classes can't cross route scopes; the cost of strict
  per-route scoping).
- **SEO mechanics:** page-level `metadata` (title/description) + semantic H1/H2 + **FAQPage JSON-LD**
  rendered server-side in `page.tsx` from the SAME `FAQ` data as the visible accordion (can't drift)
  — the PM's key lever (competitors have FAQ copy, no schema). FAQ answers stay in the DOM
  (grid-rows 0fr→1fr animation) so they're crawlable.
- **Two brand primitives, both SSOT components** (S2 audit #2): **`<Wordmark/>`** (`components/Wordmark.tsx`
  + global `.bai-wordmark`): "BlueAI" in the full iris→cyan gradient (clip), one word, Bricolage 700 —
  every nav + both footers + style guide. **`<Sparkle/>`** (`components/Sparkle.tsx`): the canonical lucide
  "Sparkles" CTA icon — `size` prop OR `className="spark"` (CSS-sized). Was inlined in 6 files; now one
  source, used by all 5 Download CTAs (`DownloadCta`/`HeroCta`/`HeroStage`/`SeoHero`/`SeoCta`). The scene
  "generate" glyph (simpler, no accent marks — a DIFFERENT role) was intentionally NOT merged. Logo =
  official `public/blueai-icon-RzIisCsb.png`. Both documented in `/style-guide` (Foundations type +
  the "Download CTA" component card, which renders the REAL `<DownloadCta/>` under a `.bai-home` wrapper).
  → taste rule 19, reasonings "brand primitives as SSOT".
- **Root `/` = Screen Library index** (`app/page.tsx`): a light DS-styled directory linking every page
  via full-page `<a>`. Replaced the redirect-to-style-guide; the style guide is now DS-only.
- **Ambient backdrop** (`SeoBackdrop`): `position:fixed` layer behind content (content gets `z-index:1`).
  Soft iris/cyan/blue orbs drift via framer `useScroll`+`useTransform` (each a different path →
  recomposes per section) + a faint logo sparkle rotating ~720° across the scroll. On mobile it's
  pinned top-right (left-half visible, big) as a slow gear. All gated on `useReducedMotion`. → taste rule 21.
- **Scroll-reveal** (`useReveal`): one IntersectionObserver adds `is-in` to `[data-reveal]` (fade+rise
  once, then unobserve); reduced-motion reveals everything immediately.

## PM-supplement tokens (S1 — filled from the blueai-pm DS)
- `accent` (`#1990FF` + `accent-hover`) — interactive primary for **app** surfaces (the
  marketing site keeps the iris→cyan gradient). `bg-accent` / `text-accent`.
- `status` group — `status-{success,warning,danger,info,scheduled,jobs}` each with a `-soft`
  (badge bg) + `-ink` (badge text). Status badges = `rounded-sm` + soft bg + ink text. Shown
  in `/style-guide` → Components.
- Shadows: Tailwind defaults `shadow-sm/md/lg/xl` match PM's scale; modern's `float`/`overlay` are extras.
- Future blueAI **app** components (badges/inputs/nav/chat bubbles/credits modal/overview cards)
  + the Heroicons-outline icon set → spec in `design-source/blueai-pm/` (README + preview/ + ui_kits/webapp/).

## DS audit + PM app-components incorporated (S1 audit)
- **Radius scale (complete):** `rounded-badge 2 · card 8 · field 12 · chat 16 · credits 24 · pill 128 · circle` + `bubble-sent/recv`. (added chat/credits/badge in the audit.)
- **Shadow scale:** `shadow-float · overlay · cta · cta-hover · brand-sm` (the brand-glow `cta`/`cta-hover` + the `cta-gradient` were inlined on every Download CTA → tokenized; the 4 hero/home stylesheets now reference `var(--bai-cta-gradient)` / `var(--bai-shadow-cta)`). Tailwind defaults `shadow-sm/md/lg/xl` also available.
- **Badge system (3 shapes):** status chips (`rounded-badge`, soft fill, no border) · pill badges (`rounded-pill`, soft fill, outline on emphasis) · outline tags (`rounded-card` border-only) · credits gradient-border pill. See taste rule 12. Showcased in `/style-guide` → Status badges + Pill badges.
- **`indigo` token** (`indigo` / `-soft` / `-ink`, PM #4F46E5) — PM's secondary interactive (cards, nav hover, overview icon bg). Used by the app-component sections.
- **PM app-component sections** built into `/style-guide` (group "App components (PM)"): `components/style-guide/PmComponentsA.tsx` (Cards · Overview cards · Inputs & forms) + `PmComponentsB.tsx` (Navigation · Credits button/alerts/modal · Icons). These document the shipping web-app DS; the marketing site doesn't use them. The full webapp UI-kit *screens* remain the live product (not rebuilt).

## Token hygiene
- **Tokenisation TIERING (the operating rule — S2 audit #2):** "fully tokenised" ≠ "every hex is a
  token." **Tier 1** — a literal equal to a DS-primitive value (iris/cyan/ink/accent) is a LEAK → use
  the token. **Tier 2** — a color used on >1 surface → promote to a GLOBAL token. **Tier 3** — bespoke
  scene-illustration colors (fake-chart fills `#c9d3ee`/`#aab9e6`, creator-pink `#c2418a`, success-ink
  `#0f7a3b`, icon-tile tints) → stay LOCAL; promoting one-offs pollutes the DS. Tokenise design
  *decisions*, not decoration — and STATE the Tier-3 boundary out loud, don't silently skip it.
- **Marketing-surface palette is now GLOBAL** (`--bai-mkt-slate/blue/blue-2/green/green-wash` in
  globals.css; S2 audit #2 — this SUPERSEDES the earlier "keep marketing locals in the section
  stylesheets" guidance). It was duplicated identically across 7 files (`--bh-*`, `--seo-*`, the heroes'
  `--slate-900`/`--green`) → Tier 2 → one source; per-file locals now alias it. `--bh-orange` folded
  into `--bai-jobs` (same value). `--font-head`/`--font-mono` stay per-stylesheet locals — fonts, fine.
- **Alpha washes now tokenised via rgb-channel tokens** (S2 audit #2 — frontier CLOSED). `rgba()` can't
  take a solid `--bai-iris` token, so the RGB triple gets its own token: `--bai-iris-rgb: 123, 76, 255`
  → `rgba(var(--bai-iris-rgb), α)`. The solid DERIVES from it too (`--bai-iris: rgb(var(--bai-iris-rgb))`)
  → the numbers live in ONE place. Channel tokens: `--bai-{iris,cyan,glow}-rgb` (glow = #5F46FF brand
  shadow) + `--bai-mkt-{blue,blue-2,green}-rgb`. All 7 stylesheets + globals swept. **Pattern to reuse:**
  any color that appears BOTH solid and as an rgba wash → define the channel triple, derive both.
- **Still raw, by stated boundary:** `.tsx` rgba in SVG `<stop stop-color>`, Tailwind-arbitrary values
  (`shadow-[…rgba(…)]`), and one inline page-bg gradient — `var()` is unreliable in SVG/JS-driven values
  and fragile in Tailwind arbitrary syntax. Tailwind `bg-iris/10` alpha modifiers also DON'T work (vars
  aren't channel triples for Tailwind's opacity plugin) — use `bg-bai-wash` or explicit rgba.


## blueai-desktop traps (2026-08-03 — the ACTIVE surface; everything above this heading is the dormant marketing site)

- **A shared DOM node needs a permanent home, not a detach-and-remember.** Three elements on this surface are
  MOVED between parents rather than rebuilt: `#baiSchedForm`, the single date/time picker, and the `+ New task`
  row. Two real bugs came from getting this wrong: a bare `container.innerHTML = ''` DESTROYS a child another
  function still cares about, and a bare `removeChild` ORPHANS it — a detached node with no live parent is
  invisible to `getElementById` and nothing re-attaches it. The pattern that works: an always-attached hidden
  parking element (`#baiDtPickerHome`, `#baiSchedAddHome`) and `appendChild` MOVES between two live parents, so
  the node is never parentless. Any function that wipes a container must park first — and factor the parking
  into one shared helper, so a future third wipe site fails loudly instead of silently.
- **Editing a CSS comment can silently delete the rule beneath it.** The existing gotcha entry above covers a
  stray `*/` while *authoring* comment prose. It bit again on 2026-08-03 in a different shape: two comment
  EDITS each left the original terminator in place, orphaning a `*/`, which dropped `.bai-schedform` entirely
  and made a `position: sticky` footer compute `static`. The failure is invisible in the source and produces a
  plausible-looking page. **Verification step, now standard:** after any comment edit, assert `/*` count ==
  `*/` count, zero orphan terminators by a depth scan, and `{` count == `}` count. It is three lines of Python
  and it catches a class of break that no screenshot will show you.
- **Assert computed values, never appearance.** The broken-stylesheet bug above was caught because a probe read
  `getComputedStyle(el).position` and got `static`. The screenshots taken in the same minute looked fine and
  were invalid. Any harness that renders something is not thereby a harness that renders the RIGHT thing.
- **The screenshot harness has two traps of its own, both of which produce clean-looking lies.** (1) `.drawer`
  is `translateX`'d off-screen until `.open`, and it does not boot until the real trigger runs — an element
  screenshot of it before that captures the BlueStacks mock sitting behind it, which reads as a pass. Open it
  by clicking `.bs-window`, and use Playwright's `reducedMotion: 'reduce'` so the boot animation is skipped
  rather than caught mid-assembly. (2) Forcing the drawer's `height` inline makes the element taller than the
  canvas inside it, so the demo scene shows through the bottom — which reads as a broken light theme. Pin the
  WIDTH only.
- **Know which element is the scroll container before scripting against it.** Removing the form's `.bai-newitem`
  wrapper moved scrolling from the form to `.bai-subpane-body`; a harness still setting `scrollTop` on the form
  silently did nothing and produced screenshots of the wrong region.

- **`#scaler` transforms the whole app, so `getBoundingClientRect()` and `offsetWidth/offsetHeight` live in
  DIFFERENT coordinate spaces — and mixing them is a category error, not a rounding error. CONFIRMED TWICE
  (2026-08-10/11), which is why this is a KB entry and not a decision row.** The app is rendered inside a
  `#scaler` element carrying a CSS `transform: scale()` (compact width measures ~0.33; wide is 1.0). Rects are
  therefore in SCALED viewport pixels, while everything you WRITE (`style.left/top/width`) and everything
  `offset*` reports are in UNSCALED local pixels — the space the design is actually authored in.
  - *Instance 1 — writing a scaled value as a local one:* `placeFloating()` positioned the date picker from
    raw rect deltas. At a 620px-tall window (scale ~0.92) the picker came out 279px wide against a 305px
    field and overlapped it by 12px; at 520px wide (scale ~0.33) it came out 36px wide against a 110px field.
    Fix: compute `s = clip.getBoundingClientRect().width / clip.offsetWidth` once, divide every measured
    delta by it before writing.
  - *Instance 2 — comparing a scaled measurement against a px threshold:* `icon-target-audit.js`'s first run
    measured control boxes with rects and compared them against a 22px floor, reporting **54 false failures**
    at compact width on controls it had just PASSED at wide width. Fix: measure with `offsetWidth/offsetHeight`,
    which are immune to ancestor transforms, so the numbers are directly comparable to the tokens.
  - **The rule:** any px number that will be compared to a token, or written back as a style value, must come
    from `offset*` or be divided by the measured scale first. Rects are only safe for comparing two rects to
    each other. A harness that reports a clean pass at wide width and garbage at compact width is showing you
    this trap, not a responsive bug.
- **`function f(x, d) { ... d || DEFAULT }` cannot express a deliberate zero — and this codebase uses that
  convention.** `startFlow(name, initialDelay)` runs `setTimeout(runStep, initialDelay || 800)`, so calling
  `startFlow('plan', 0)` to mean "start immediately" silently gets 800ms instead. It surfaced as a reply that
  read as hanging (the caller had already spent its own thinking beat). **Before passing 0 / '' / false to any
  helper in this file, grep the helper for `||` in its parameter handling** — and when the intent really is
  "no delay," pass a small non-zero value (120) with a comment saying why it isn't 0, because 0 is the value
  that looks correct and behaves wrongly.
  **WIDENED 2026-08-11 — the mechanism is bigger than `||`, and DECLARATION ORDER is the same bug.** This
  file's inline script is one long IIFE, so `var` declarations hoist their NAME to the top and leave the
  ASSIGNMENT where it was written. `var bsInstalled = true, baiInstalled = true` sat ~117 lines *below*
  `renderPreviewRows()`, which reads both — so the install checkboxes rendered UNCHECKED on a machine where
  both are installed. Nothing threw: `undefined` is falsy, and **falsy is indistinguishable from a deliberate
  `false` at the point of use**, which is why the output was a plausible wrong state rather than an error.
  That is the same root as `d || DEFAULT`: a value that cannot express its own absence, so absence
  impersonates a legitimate value. **Two habits close both:** in a file this long, declare state ABOVE its
  first reader and not next to its conceptual neighbours (mine sat with the scene mechanics, which read as
  the natural home and was wrong); and when a falsy value is meaningful, test `=== undefined` / `!= null`
  rather than truthiness. Grep target for the order problem: any `var` whose name appears earlier in the file
  than its own declaration line.
- **A throw inside `requestAnimationFrame` (or any async callback) surfaces NOWHERE in the UI — the animation
  just stops mid-way and looks finished.** `bsInstallCard(app)` shipped without its parameter while
  referencing `app`, so the rAF tick threw `ReferenceError` on the frame that completes the install: the
  progress card reached "Getting ready 100%", stopped, and the entire scene payoff (the player mounting and
  cycling its frames) never ran. On screen it read as a *finished* install. Nothing in the DOM, no visible
  error state, no failed assertion — **only the console had it.** The same applies to `setTimeout`,
  `addEventListener`, promise bodies and `IntersectionObserver`: a throw kills that callback silently and
  leaves whatever it had already done on screen, which is the most convincing possible wrong state.
  **So when a scripted sequence stops part-way, read the console BEFORE re-reading the code** — the failure
  mode of "it ran and then just stopped" is almost always a thrown callback, and re-reading your own logic
  is exactly the search that cannot find it.
- **A harness that returns an empty result set is reporting a broken harness, not a clean surface — assert
  liveness explicitly or a silent zero reads as a pass.** Repeatedly this session: an icon census returned
  zero controls for 6 consecutive contexts because an `Escape` keypress had closed the drawer (every later
  `offsetParent` was null); a calendar probe compared two EMPTY arrays and reported "no content shift"; a
  settings-dropdown probe measured a row that was scrolled out of view and reported every item unreachable.
  All three produced confident, wrong conclusions. **The fixes, now standard in any harness here:** (1) after
  each navigation step, assert the app is actually visible (`#baiUi.show` + a non-trivial height) and record
  a FAILURE, never a skip, if not; (2) assert the collection you are about to compare is non-empty before
  drawing any conclusion from it; (3) `scrollIntoView` before measuring anything you reached programmatically.
  Related to *"assert computed values, never appearance"* above — that one is about screenshots lying; this
  one is about an empty measurement lying, which is worse, because zero findings reads as good news.
