/* ==========================================================================
   onBlue: the state toggler. A review control, not part of the product.

   EVERYTHING IT STYLES IS DEFINED IN HERE, and everything it switches is
   defined in onblue.css. That split is the point: delete this file and the
   page loses a shortcut, not a variant. The minimal steps still exist and are
   still reachable by putting .is-min on the dialog by hand.

   TWO PAGES, ONE BAR, AND IT ONLY APPEARS WHERE ITS STATES ARE. On the homepage
   it switches the access dialog's four steps between Full and Minimal, and it
   exists only while that dialog is open. On the application it switches the page
   between the application flow and the approved dashboard.
   The dialog case also solves the top layer: a <dialog> opened with showModal()
   sits above everything, and no z-index outside it can reach, so a bar parked on
   <body> would be buried at exactly the moment it is needed. Inside the dialog
   it is both reachable and nowhere else.
