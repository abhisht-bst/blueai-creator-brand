   onBlue: the state toggler. A review control, not part of the product.

   EVERYTHING IT STYLES IS DEFINED IN HERE, and everything it switches is
   defined in onblue.css. That split is the point: delete this file and the
   page loses a shortcut, not a variant. The minimal steps still exist and are
   still reachable by putting .is-min on the dialog by hand.

   TWO PAGES, TWO DOCKS, AND EACH ONLY APPEARS WHERE ITS STATES ARE. On the
   homepage it switches the access dialog's four steps between Full and Minimal,
   and it exists only while that dialog is open.
   THE OTHER TWO ARE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND THE PAGE SAYS WHICH. apply.html is
   the creators' side - an application that becomes a creator dashboard - and
   campaign.html is the agencies' - a review gate in front of a campaigns app.
   They share the word "dash" and nothing else, and for one commit this file
   keyed off that word alone and built the agency's three bars on both. On
   apply.html two of those three called doors that page does not have, so the
   creator dashboard became unreachable from its own toggler. #dash declares
   data-dock now; a page that does not is not guessed at.
   The dialog case also solves the top layer: a <dialog> opened with showModal()
   sits above everything, and no z-index outside it can reach, so a bar parked on
   <body> would be buried at exactly the moment it is needed. Inside the dialog
   it is both reachable and nowhere else.
